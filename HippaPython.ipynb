      "Senators Demand Answers from Google About Sensitive Location Data Deletion Practices\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 31, 2023\n",
      "A group of 10 Senators has written to Google demanding answers about its policies for deleting sensitive location data, such as visits to abortion clinics, fertility centers, domestic violence shelters, addiction treatment facilities, and other sensitive locations. Following the decision of the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v Wade and removed the federal right to abortion, Google announced that it would be introducing a new data deletion policy and would be deleting precise geolocation data that indicated a visit to certain sensitive locations. Visits to sensitive locations are highly personal and the information could be abused. Location data could be used by third parties for targeted advertising related to sensitive medical conditions or individuals could be targeted based on their personal healthcare decisions.\n",
      "The policy announcement was made in July 2022, and Google said the change would take effect in the coming weeks, yet the policy does not appear to have been consistently implemented. The Washington Post investigated to determine the extent to which geolocation data was being deleted by Google and sent reporters to hospitals, fertility clinics, and Planned Parenthood clinics in several states. The reporters found that Google stored the exact name and address of the location they visited, such as the Planned Parenthood Clinic – San Francisco Health Center. In other cases, Google recorded a visit to a nearby establishment or the general neighborhood, and in other cases, the location data was deleted within 24 hours. Another report revealed Google only deleted sensitive location data in 60% of test cases, despite Google claiming that precise geolocation data would be deleted. The Senators said that if the data deletion policy is not consistently applied, it could be considered a deceptive practice.\n",
      "Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mazie Hirono (D-HA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Edward Markey (D-MA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Patty Murray (D-WA) expressed their concern that Google was not upholding its commitment to delete sensitive location data, especially visits to reproductive health care facilities.\n",
      "The Senators asked Google to confirm how its systems identify a visit to a sensitive location and requested a complete list of the metadata used to make that determination, along with any supporting documents. They also requested a complete list of the locations Google considers sensitive, asked for clarification on how long sensitive location data is stored after a visit, and whether Google allows advertisers to target individuals based on visits to sensitive locations that could reveal a user’s health information. They also asked Google to commit to consistently deleting sensitive location data related to any visit to a reproductive health care facility within 24 hours of that visit occurring and to agree to a third-party audit to verify that such a protocol has been implemented.\n",
      "The Senators gave Google until May 26, 2023, to respond and provide answers.\n",

      "Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers in Illinois has launched an investigation into a cyberattack that the Royal ransomware group has claimed responsibility for. Third-party forensics experts have been engaged to investigate the breach and determine the extent to which patient information was involved. While the investigation is still in the early stages, Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers has confirmed that its electronic medical record system was unaffected; however, patient data was stored in the network that was compromised in the attack.\n",
      "Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers said it had implemented multiple security measures prior to the attack and that these were instrumental in limiting the severity of the incident. Further information will be released as the investigation progresses, and notification letters will be issued if it is determined that patient data has been compromised. On May 22, 2023, the Royal ransomware group added Morris Hospital & Healthcare Centers to its data leak site along with a sample of files allegedly stolen in the attack.\n",
      "Norton Healthcare Recovering from Cyberattack\n",
      "Norton Healthcare, a Kentucky-based operator of more than 140 clinics and hospitals in the Louisville area of Kentucky and Southern Indiana, has confirmed that it suffered a cybersecurity incident on May 9, 2023. Norton confirmed that its network is operational and that systems were proactively taken offline as a precaution and confirmed that at no point did the attackers have control of its network.\n",
      "With IT systems offline, the staff switched to manual processes for recording patient information but said all of its facilities remained open and were able to continue to provide care to patients, although there have been delays to some services due to IT systems being offline, including medical imaging, lab test results, and prescription refills, and that there was a backlog of messages from its online patient portal which are taking time to work through and has caused delays to responses.\n",
      "The threat actor behind the attack issued threats and demands via fax, but it is unclear at this stage to what extent, if any, patient data has been stolen. Norton did not state whether ransomware was used in the attack. Notifications will be issued to patients if it is determined that their information has been exposed or compromised.\n",

The third-party forensic investigation determined that an unauthorized individual gained access to some of its IT systems between March 20, 2023, and March 24, 2023, and may have accessed or acquired files that contained patient information.\n",
      "By May 2, 2023, it had been confirmed that patient data had been compromised, including names, contact information, dates of birth, diagnosis and treatment information, provider names, dates of service, cost of services, prescription information, and/or health insurance information, but the extent to which patients have been affected has not yet been disclosed.\n",
      "The incident has been reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights as affecting 500 individuals – a common placeholder that is used until the full extent of a breach is known. Notification letters will be issued to affected individuals when the review of the affected files has been completed. Tennessee Orthopaedic Clinics said additional safeguards and technical security measures have been implemented to prevent similar security breaches in the future.\n",

      "Ohio Hospital Exposed Nurses and Other Staff to Workplace Violence\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 30, 2023\n",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has determined a children’s hospital in Columbus, Ohio failed to adequately protect healthcare employees from workplace violence. Patients attacked nurses and other healthcare professionals and their bites, kicks, punches, and other assaults resulted in staff members sustaining serious injuries.\n",
      "An investigation was launched by OSHA in November 2022 following complaints from nurses and mental health staff at the Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion at Nationwide Children’s Hospital who had suffered serious injuries due to violent patient incidents, including lacerations, concussions, and sprains. Nationwide Children’s Hospital is the second-largest pediatric hospital in the United States and operates 68 facilities throughout Ohio and accepted over 1.5 million patient visits a year. The Big Lots Behavioral Health Pavilion provides acute behavioral healthcare services through intensive outpatient programs.\n",
      "OSHA determined that employees at the facility were exposed to the hazard of workplace violence due to insufficient safety controls. Incidents included groping, biting, kicking, punching, head-butting, and scratching, which resulted in several employees suffering serious injuries during the admission process. The facility also failed to maintain proper records about injuries to its employees in the workplace.\n",
      "OSHA issued a citation for one serious violation due to the failure to protect its workers from workplace violence and one other-than-serious violation related to records of incidents of workplace violence. Corrective actions have been recommended to improve safety in the workplace and $18,000 in penalties have been proposed. The Behavioral Health Pavilion at Nationwide Children’s Hospital has 15 days from the date the citations were issued to comply, request an informal conference with the OSHA Area Director, or contest the findings.\n",
      "The suggested control measures to improve safety include the development and implementation of a written workplace violence prevention program specific to the conditions and hazards at the facility, specific written procedures for employees to take when encountering or responding to an incident of workplace violence, the development and implementation of standardized patient admission protocols to address patient on staff workplace violence, controls to prevent patients from using furniture as weapons, and to ensure there is adequate staffing to safely address changes in patient acuity and patient census.\n",
      "“Behavioral healthcare workers can be exposed to risks when treating patients who suffer with conditions that can lead to violent outbursts,” said OSHA Area Director Larry Johnson in Columbus, Ohio. “Unfortunately, Nationwide Children’s Hospital failed to take the necessary precautions that could have prevented their employees from being injured.”\n",

      "Managed Care of North America Hacking Incident Impacts 8.9 Million Individuals\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 30, 2023\n",
      "Managed Care of North America, Inc. (MCNA), which also does business as MCNA Dental –  a provider of dental benefits and services for state Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Programs – has recently reported a major data breach to the Maine Attorney General that has affected 8,923,662 individuals. This is the largest healthcare data breach to be reported by a single covered entity so far this year, and the second 5 million record+ healthcare data breach to be reported this month.\n",
      "On March 6, 2023, MCNA discovered an unauthorized third party was able to access certain systems within its IT network. The threat was immediately contained and a third-party cybersecurity firm was engaged to investigate the intrusion and determine the nature and scope of the incident. The forensic investigation determined that the network had been compromised and infected with malicious code and that the attackers removed some copies of personal and protected health information from its systems between February 26, 2023, and March 7, 2023.\n",
      "The review of the files that were copied or potentially accessed confirmed that they contained protected health information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued ID numbers, health insurance information, Medicare/Medicaid ID numbers, group plan names and numbers, and information related to the dental and orthodontic care provided. The types of compromised information varied from individual to individual. MCNA said it is unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of the affected data. MCNA said it has enhanced its security controls and monitoring practices to minimize the risk of further incidents of this nature in the future.\n",
      "The LockBit ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack and leaked some of the stolen data on its dark web data leak site as proof of data theft, and demanded a $10 million ransom to prevent the publication of all of the stolen data. It appears that the ransom was not paid, as the group published the stolen files on April 7, 2023.\n",
      "Affected individuals are now being notified and are being offered complimentary credit monitoring services for 1 or 2 years, dictated by the minimum terms required by state laws. MCNA sent notifications on behalf of Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, and the following 112 insurance plans:\n",

      "State of HIPAA – May 2023 Report\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 29, 2023\n",
      "It has been 27 years since President Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) into law – and 21 years since the first of the Administrative Simplification Rules became effective – but HIPAA compliance is still proving a challenge for many HIPAA-regulated entities. This article explores the current state of HIPAA and some of the main aspects of the HIPAA Rules that are proving difficult for HIPAA-regulated entities.\n",
      "HIPAA Enforcement\n",
      "The HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has been enforcing HIPAA compliance more aggressively in recent years and 2022 was a record year, with 22 settlements and civil monetary penalties (CMPs) imposed to resolve violations of the HIPAA Rules. The majority of the financial penalties imposed in 2022 resolved violations of the HIPAA Right of Access, as has been the case for the past 3 years; however, OCR is now starting to impose more fines for other violations of the HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "OCR has faced challenges with HIPAA enforcement due to a significant increase in its workload in recent years while its budget has remained flat. OCR investigates all data breaches of 500 or more records, and data breaches have been increasing at an alarming rate in recent years. OCR explained in its annual report to Congress that since fiscal year 2017, OCR has received a 100% increase in large breach reports, largely driven by an increase in hacking incidents, especially ransomware attacks. In 2021, 75% of breaches of 500 or more records were the result of hacking incidents and those breaches accounted for 95% of all breached records. in 2017, hacking incidents accounted for 41.6% of data breaches and 69.5% of breached records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over that same period, there was also a 28% increase in complaints about potential HIPAA violations, which also need to be investigated. OCR’s hands are somewhat tied as funding has remained flat for years and OCR is also having to cope with inflationary increases. OCR explained that it has been forced to decrease its enforcement staff by 45%, and with its resources under incredible strain, that naturally has an impact on the speed of investigations and the number of cases where financial penalties can be pursued.\n",
      "OCR can increase funding through its enforcement actions, but despite OCR more than doubling the number of settlements and CMPs in 2022 compared to 2017-2019 levels, OCR had a 92.6% reduction in total penalties compared to 2018, falling from $28.7 million in 2018 to just $1.6 million in 2022. The average HIPAA penalty has fallen from $2.6 million in 2018 (median: $500,000) to just $407,000 in 2022 (median: $183,250). The decrease in penalties is due to a reinterpretation of the language of the HITECH Act, which has seen the maximum penalties for HIPAA violations reduced in three of the four penalty tiers. OCR has asked Congress to increase the maximum penalties for HIPAA violations, but there are no indications that penalties will be increased, and until that occurs, OCR will struggle to increase funds significantly through its enforcement actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The budgetary pressures have forced OCR to look at other ways of increasing funding such as improving efficiency and productivity through restructuring and getting better use of its existing resources. The recent restructuring, which has seen OCR create a new enforcement division, will allow it to investigate data breaches faster, clear the current backlog of investigations, and impose more financial penalties. We can therefore expect this year to close with a high number of financial penalties, and 2024 may well see record numbers of fines issued to resolve compliance issues.\n",
      "OCR Director, Melanie Fontes Rainer, has confirmed that OCR’s HIPAA Right of Access enforcement initiative will continue, and OCR is making compliance with HIPAA with respect to reproductive healthcare information an enforcement priority, as well as HIPAA Security Rule compliance to protect against the increasing numbers of hacking incidents. She has also confirmed that OCR will be actively investigating the use of website tracking technologies following OCR’s December 2022 release of new HIPAA guidance.\n",
      "State attorneys general also enforce the HIPAA Rules and 2023 has already seen several enforcement actions over violations of HIPAA and state privacy laws. As of May 2023, state attorneys general in Florida, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania have taken action against HIPAA-regulated entities for security failures that have led to data breaches.\n",
      "The State of HIPAA Compliance\n",
      "OCR has conducted two rounds of compliance audits to assess the state of HIPAA compliance since the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules were enacted. The second phase of HIPAA audits was launched in 2016, and while OCR has announced its intention to conduct an ongoing program of compliance audits, they have failed to materialize due to budget constraints and it is unlikely that those plans will be resurrected until OCR’s funding issues have been resolved. The 2016-2017 HIPAA audit program identified many areas of noncompliance. Most covered entities were found to have failed to have achieved compliance in the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "HIPAA Security Rule risk analysis and risk management requirements\n",
      "Timely breach notifications and adequate content of breach notifications\n",
      "Prominent posts of Notices of Privacy Practices on websites and insufficient content of those notices\n",

      "Top HIPAA Security Rule Compliance Challenges in 2023\n",
      "Complying with all HIPAA provisions and implementation specifications can be a challenge, especially for smaller healthcare providers and business associates that do not have extensive resources available to devote to HIPAA compliance. While there are many aspects of the HIPAA Security Rule that can prove challenging, there are some common areas of vulnerability that are identified time and again in OCR’s investigations.\n",
      "Risk Analyses\n",
      "The HIPAA Security Rule requires regulated entities to conduct a comprehensive and accurate organization-wide risk analysis to identify risks and vulnerabilities to electronic protected health information (ePHI). The risk analysis process needs to be ongoing, and the best practice is to conduct these at least annually or as needed, such as following any material change to policies and procedures or changes in technology. The risk analysis must be comprehensive, which means an organization must identify all ePHI within the organization, external ePHI created received, or maintained by business associates, and all threats to that information must be identified, including human, natural, and environmental threats to ePHI and the systems on which the information is stored. The HHS has developed a Security Risk Assessment Tool to help regulated entities with this vital process.\n",
      "Risk Management Processes\n",
      "Once risks and vulnerabilities have been identified they must be subjected to risk management processes and be reduced to a low and acceptable level in a timely manner. Risks must be assessed and remediations prioritized to ensure the risks that are most likely to be exploited are addressed first. Risk management processes also need to be extended to third parties – business associates – which means performing due diligence on vendors throughout the supply chain and implementing processes to identify, assess, and manage vendor risk at each stage of the vendor life cycle – onboarding, ongoing, and offboarding. Reducing risk exposure from vendor relationships is one of the biggest security challenges in healthcare in 2023 and a pressing issue, as hackers are actively targeting the supply chain.\n",
      "Technical Security Controls\n",
      "The HIPAA Security Rule does not specify the technical controls that should be implemented to secure systems containing ePHI, as these need to be based on the specific IT architectures of each regulated entity. It is the responsibility of each regulated entity to ensure that appropriate security controls are implemented and that they are effective at reducing risk. Security controls need to be regularly subjected to security assessments to make sure they have been implemented correctly, are operating as intended, and are achieving the desired outcome. HIPAA-regulated entities should conduct vulnerability scans and consider penetration testing to gain a better understanding of vulnerabilities to allow them to be properly managed.\n",
      "Audit Controls and Information System Activity Reviews\n",
      "All IT systems that contact ePHI must have audit controls and create logs of system activity and information system activity reviews should be conducted on audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports. Despite information system activity reviews being a requirement of the HIPAA Security Rule, OCR’s investigations have revealed many organizations only conduct reviews on an ad-hoc basis in response to potential security incidents. Regular reviews allow HIPAA-regulated entities to rapidly identify unauthorized access to ePHI by malicious insiders and hackers. All too often, regulated entities discover unauthorized access by insiders and hackers has been ongoing for months or years.\n",
      "Access Controls\n",
      "Technical policies and procedures need to be developed, implemented, and maintained for all electronic information systems that contain or allow access to ePHI to only allow access to persons or software programs that have been granted access rights per the organization’s access management policies and procedures. Access controls need to be based on the principle of least privilege, and access must be promptly revoked when individuals leave employment or no longer require access to ePHI. Ineffective access controls can be exploited by malicious actors to move laterally within networks and gain access to huge volumes of ePHI.\n",
      "Telehealth Services\n",
      "In response to the pandemic, OCR introduced telehealth flexibilities to make it easier for HIPAA-regulated entities to provide virtual care to clients and exercised enforcement discretion with regard to the technologies that can be used to provide these services. Now that the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency has been declared over, that period of enforcement discretion is due to terminate. OCR’s notice of enforcement discretion for telehealth expired at 11:59 p.m. on May 11, 2023, but HIPAA-regulated entities have been given a 90-day transition period that comes to an end on August 9, 2023, by which time telehealth platforms must be compliant with the HIPAA Security Rule.\n",
      "Challenges with HIPAA Privacy Rule Compliance in 2023\n",
      "There are several aspects of HIPAA Privacy Rule compliance that are likely to prove challenging for HIPAA-regulated entities in 2023 and OCR has confirmed that these HIPAA Privacy Rule issues are still or will be enforcement priorities in 2023 and beyond.\n",
      "Timely Access to Medical Records\n",
      "The 2016 HIPAA compliance audits identified widespread noncompliance with the HIPAA Right of Access and increasing numbers of complaints were being received from individuals struggling to obtain copies of their medical records. OCR launched a new compliance initiative in 2019 targeting noncompliance with the HIPAA Right of Access, and the bulk of OCR’s subsequent enforcement actions to date have been for noncompliance with the HIPAA Right of Access. OCR is continuing with this enforcement initiative, and further, the proposed Privacy Rule changes that are expected to be finalized in 2023 will likely see the time frame for providing records decrease from 30 days to 15 days.\n",
      "Tracking Technologies\n",
      "In 2022, investigations into the use of tracking technologies on websites revealed the extent to which these third-party code snippets were being used by healthcare organizations. The code snippets collect valuable data on websites and web app user activity, which can be used to improve those services; however, the code can also collect identifiable health information and transmit that information to third parties. Those third parties typically do not sign business associate agreements, and using the code without a BAA in place or first obtaining consent from individuals to share that information is a HIPAA violation. Now that OCR has released guidance on HIPAA and tracking technologies, healthcare organizations must ensure that if the code is used, it is HIPAA compliant.\n",
      "Disclosures of Reproductive Health Information\n",
      "The decision of the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization removed the federal right to abortion, leaving it to individual states to decide on the legality of abortions in their respective states. As of May 2023, 14 states have implemented near-total bans on abortions, a further 6 have implemented gestational limits, and a further 6 states have attempted to introduce bans but have faced legal challenges.\n",
      "Fears exist that some anti-abortion states may attempt to take legal action against individuals that facilitate terminations in states with legal abortions. As well as being concerned this might lead to permissible disclosures being used to prosecute an individual for an event that was legal in the state in which it happened, OCR is concerned the threat of criminal action may prevent some patients from sharing important health information with their healthcare providers. Consequently, OCR is proposing a new category of PHI for reproductive health information. If finalized, Covered Entities will only be allowed to disclose reproductive health information (other than for TPO purposes) to third parties who attest the disclosure will not be used to prosecute facilitators of terminations in states where abortions are legal. False attestations will be considered wrongful disclosures under §1177 of the Social Security Act.\n",
      "Staff Training\n",
      "The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlighted the extent to which data breaches are caused by human error. Out of all data breaches analyzed by Verizon in 2022, 82% involved the human element. Those data breaches include misconfigurations, responses to phishing and social engineering attacks, failures to set strong passwords, and other mistakes. These mistakes often exposed ePHI and make it easy for hackers to gain access to healthcare networks. The only way of tackling human error is through education. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires regulated entities to provide training on HIPAA policies relevant to each individual’s role, while the HIPAA Security Rule requires a security awareness training program. In the case of the latter, increasing the frequency of training can help to create a security culture and eradicate bad security practices.\n",
      "Looking Forward – Pending Changes to the HIPAA Rules\n",
      "While updates to the HIPAA Rules are made fairly infrequently, there are pending changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, due in 2023 along with updates to the Part 2 regulations to align them more closely with HIPAA. OCR has also recently announced its intention to improve privacy protections for reproductive health information through new HIPAA rulemaking, and the HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed updates to transaction code sets to enable the electronic transmission of healthcare attachment transactions. States are also introducing new laws to better protect the privacy of state residents and ensure they are notified in the event of privacy breaches. Staying up to date with changes to state laws and ensuring compliance will be an ongoing challenge.\n",
      "While the proposed HIPAA updates are intended to improve the privacy and security of personally identifiable information and reduce the administrative burden on HIPAA-regulated entities, they are a cause of concern for many HIPAA-regulated entities which will have to spend considerable time and effort implementing the changes and ensuring their employees are fully trained. The HHS will provide a grace period to allow the changes to be implemented before compliance becomes mandatory, but it is important to start updating policies and procedures as soon as possible to ensure compliance with these new requirements to ensure the deadlines are not missed.\n",

      "Ransomware Gangs Claim Three Healthcare Victims\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 26, 2023\n",
      "There has been a growing breach notification trend where the exact nature of a cyberattack is not disclosed in breach notification letters, including whether there has been confirmed theft of patient data. The failure to provide this information makes it difficult for victims of data breaches to assess the level of risk they face. That appears to be the case with two recent cyberattacks, neither of which mention ransomware or confirm that data theft occurred.\n",
      "Albany ENT & Allergy Services\n",
      "Earlier this month, two ransomware groups – BianLian and RansomHouse – added Albany ENT & Allergy Services (AENT) to their data leak sites, along with claims that 1TB of data was stolen from its network before files were encrypted. Evidence of data theft was published on the RansomHouse data leak site.\n",
      "Albany ENT & Allergy Services has now confirmed in a notification to the Maine Attorney General that unauthorized individuals gained access to its network, which contained the protected health information of 224,486 individuals, including 61 Maine residents. AENT explained in the letters that suspicious activity was detected within its computer network on March 27, 2023, and a third-party forensic investigation was conducted to determine the nature and scope of the incident. AENT said it was able to determine that “an unauthorized actor may have had access to certain systems that stored personal and protected health information,” between March 23, 2023, and April 4, 2023. A review of those files confirmed they contained employee and patient information such as names and Social Security numbers.\n",
      "Notifications started to be sent to affected individuals on March 25, 2023, and 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring services have been offered. Since it appears from the claims of the ransomware groups that data has been stolen, affected individuals should ensure they take advantage of those complimentary services. AENT said it is reviewing its policies and procedures, will provide additional training to employees, and will be implementing additional safeguards to further secure information in its systems.\n",
      "Vascular Center of Intervention, Inc.\n",
      "The Vascular Center of Intervention, Inc. (VCI) a surgical center in Fresno, CA, has recently notified patients about a security breach detected on March 29, 2023. The notification letters state that the forensic investigation of unusual network activity “determined that certain documents stored within VCI’s environment may have been copied from or viewed on the system by an unauthorized person(s) between February 25, 2023, and March 29, 2023.”\n",
      "The review of the files was completed on May 17, 2023, and confirmed that names were compromised along with one or more of the following: medical history, mental or physical condition, or medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional, date of birth, health insurance information, Social Security Number and/or Driver’s license information.  VCI said existing safeguards have been strengthened to further enhance security, and the notification to the California Attorney General indicates California residents at least will be provided with 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.\n",
      "No mention was made in the notification letters that the BianLian group claimed responsibility for the attack. The group claimed on its data leak site that 200 GB of data was exfiltrated from its systems. The BianLian group conducts ransomware attacks, although this year has largely switched to extortion-only attacks.\n",
      "It is currently unclear how many individuals have been affected\n",
      "Ohio Business Associate Suffers Ransomware Attack\n",
      "In contrast, the notification letters from Marshall Information Services (doing business as Primary Solutions Inc.) provide more information. Primary Solutions, an Ohio-based provider of billing solutions to healthcare organizations, recently notified 7,456 individuals about an August 2022 ransomware attack that prevented access to its systems. The forensic investigation confirmed that the attackers had access to parts of the network that contained documents that included the protected health information of some of its covered entity clients, and those documents may have been accessed or acquired in the attack.\n",
      "The notices explain that the documents contained first and last names combined with some or all of the following data elements: address, date of birth, Social Security number, health information such as diagnosis, condition, or treatment, medical record number, Medicare or Medicaid number, individual health insurance policy number, and in very limited cases, payment card information.\n",
      "A third-party vendor was used to review all the affected files to identify the impacted individuals and that review determined on February 22, 2023, that protected health information had been exposed. It is unclear why that process took so long. Each covered entity was then notified, and Primary Solutions said it then worked with those clients to notify the affected individuals. Primary Solutions said complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services are being offered through IDX, and it encourages impacted individuals to enroll in these services.\n",
      "In response to the incident, Primary Solutions has ensured multifactor authentication is implemented for remote access, configurations have been updated to ensure employees must access systems through a virtual private network (VPN) with multifactor authentication, and a new endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution has been implemented.\n",

      "The Complicated Nature of BAA Compliance\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 26, 2023\n",
      "In the healthcare industry, the term BAA compliance refers to a Business Associate complying with the terms of a Business Associate Agreement entered into with a Covered Entity. While, in theory, BAA compliance should be straightforward, this is not always the case – and sometimes, noncompliance is not the fault of the Business Associate.\n",
      "The HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations apply to group health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that transmit health information electronically in connection with a transaction for which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has adopted standards (i.e., transactions covered in 45 CFR Part 162).\n",
      "Many healthcare providers that qualify as “Covered Entities” are unable to manage every activity or function in-house and often subcontract some activities to third-party persons or organizations. When these activities involve the creation, receipt, storage, or transmission of PHI, third-party persons or organizations are classified as Business Associates.\n",
      "Covered Entities are required to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information, ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI, and notify individuals and HHS’ Office for Civil Rights in the event of a data breach – exposure or unauthorized access to PHI. When PHI is disclosed to a Business Associate, the Business Associate assumes some compliance requirements concerning the PHI they are provided with, collect, store, or transmit.\n",
      "Business Associates’ Compliance Requirements\n",
      "Any third party or organization acting as a Business Associate of a Covered Entity is automatically required to comply with the HIPAA Security and Breach Notification Rules. Other compliance requirements are determined by the nature of the service being provided by the Business Associate for or on behalf of the Covered Entity.\n",
      "For example, if a Business Associate is providing billing or claims management services for a Covered Entity, the Business Associate is required to comply with the transaction, code set, and operating rules of Part 162. If the Business Associate is providing outsourced medical services, the Business Associate is required to comply with certain Privacy Rule standards.\n",
      "When a Business Associate is required to comply with certain Privacy Rule standards, these should be noted in the Business Associate Agreement – along with any restrictions on uses and disclosures that would normally be allowed by the Privacy Rule but are limited due to the content of the Covered Entity’s Notice of Privacy Practices or because one or more individuals have exercised the right to request privacy protections for PHI under §164.522 of the Privacy Rule.\n",
      "The HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)\n",
      "The HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a contract between a Covered Entity and a Business Associate that establishes the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI by the Business Associate. The BAA must stipulate that uses and disclosures beyond those included in the BAA are not permitted and will result in the termination of the BAA. Other clauses in the BAA should cover:\n",
      "\n",
      "Making PHI available to individuals exercising their rights of access and amendment, and when requesting an accounting of disclosures.\n",
      "Disclosures required by state or federal law, including (if applicable) to report child abuse or comply with “duty to warn” regulations.\n",
      "Business Associate contracts with subcontractors when secondary services are required for the Business Associate to perform an activity.\n",
      "The reporting of disclosures of PHI not permitted by the BAA and other security incidents – in addition to reporting breaches of unsecured PHI.\n",
      "The term of the BAA (if applicable) and reasons why the BAA may be terminated before its recorded term – for example, a failure of BAA compliance, and the obligations of the Business associate when the contract is terminated or expires.\n",
      "Making internal practices and records available to the Secretary of the HHS for determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, BAAs are prepared by Covered Entities according to the services subcontracted to the Business Associate, but there are times when a Covered Entity must agree to a Business Associate’s BAA before it can use the Business Associate’s services. One of the best examples of this scenario is Microsoft – which refuses to sign Covered Entities’ BAAs on the grounds that it offers “hyperscale, multi-tenanted services that are standardized for all customers”.\n",
      "Why BAA Compliance is Not Always Straightforward\n",
      "It would be reasonable to assume that, if a contract states a Business Associate must comply with specific requirements to benefit from the Covered Entity’s business, the Business Associate would comply with the BAA – but that is not always the case. Some Business Associates take shortcuts with BAA compliance “to get the job done”, exposing themselves to cyberattacks, breaches due to training failures, and theft of PHI by external actors and malicious insiders.\n",
      "However, BAA compliance failures are not always the fault of the Business Associate. HHS guidance implies Covered Entities need only obtain “satisfactory assurances” that Business Associates will use PHI for the purposes for which the Business Associate is engaged before entering into a BAA. There is no legal requirement for a Covered Entity to conduct due diligence on a Business Associate to ensure that satisfactory assurances are backed up with policies, safeguards, and procedures.\n",
      "Additionally, Covered Entities’ BAAs may not always be entirely complete. Some may omit limitations to uses and disclosures of PHI, fail to insist on adequate training, or not require Business Associates to provide copies of contracts with subcontractors for review. In such cases, Business Associates may violate HIPAA through no fault of their own, yet be exposed to sanctions from HHS’ Office for Civil Rights and State Attorneys General – potentially resulting in civil monetary penalties.\n",
      "What Business Associates Need to Know about BAA Compliance\n",
      "Since the publication of the HIPAA Final Omnibus Rule, Business Associates have been liable for HIPAA violations of their own making. Unfortunately, a lack of knowledge is not a defense against a civil monetary penalty and/or costly corrective action plan. Therefore, before entering into a BAA with a Covered Entity, Business Associates are advised to thoroughly check the content of the BAA; and, if in doubt about their compliance requirements, query the issues with the Covered Entity and seek professional compliance advice.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 26, 2023\n",
      "An updated version of the StopRansomware Guide has been published that includes further recommendations on actions that can be taken to reduce the risk of ransomware attacks. The StopRansomware Guide is a one-stop resource developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) that details best practices for detecting, preventing, responding to, and recovering from ransomware attacks and provides step-by-step approaches for addressing potential attacks. The updated guide was produced through the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF), which was set up by Congress in 2022 to deal with the growing threat of ransomware attacks.\n",
      "The StopRansomware Guide can be used by government agencies and organizations and businesses of all sizes to ensure appropriate defenses are in place to block attacks and can help with the development, implementation, and maintenance of incident response plans to ensure the fastest possible recovery in the event of an attack. The updated guide includes new recommendations for hardening defenses against the most common initial access vectors that are used by ransomware gangs and initial access brokers for gaining a foothold in networks, including compromised credentials, brute force attempts to obtain passwords, phishing, and advanced social engineering, along with information on securing cloud backups and tips for threat hunting.\n",
      "The StopRansomware Guide is divided into two parts. The first part provides comprehensive, relevant, and proven best practices that can be adopted to reduce risk, including identifying critical data that needs protecting and proactive steps that can help with ransomware attack mitigation. The second part of the guide provides detailed information on detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and post-incident recovery, and includes a checklist to guide organizations through a methodical, measured, and properly managed incident response approach.\n",
      "“With our FBI, NSA and MS-ISAC partners, we strongly encourage all organizations to review this guide and implement recommendations to prevent potential ransomware incidents,” wrote CISA. “In order to address the ransomware epidemic, we must reduce the prevalence of ransomware intrusions and reduce their impacts, which include applying lessons learned from ransomware incidents that have affected far too many organizations.”\n",

      "Doctor Fined for Privacy Violations Following Abortion on 10-Year-Old Rape Victim\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 26, 2023\n",
      "Dr. Caitlin Bernard, an Indianapolis, IN-based obstetrician-gynecologist has been fined $3,000 by the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana and issued with a letter of reprimand for violating HIPAA and state privacy law after talking to the media about an abortion she provided to a 10-year-old rape victim on July 1, 2022.\n",
      "Within hours of the Supreme Court’s decision that overturned Roe v Wade and removed the federal right to an abortion, Ohio banned abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy. Three days later, on June 27, 2022, Dr. Bernard received a call from a child abuse doctor in Ohio about a 10-year-old patient who could not legally have an abortion in Ohio as she was three days past the legal cutoff. The victim then traveled from her home state of Ohio to Indiana to have the procedure performed by Dr. Bernard.\n",
      "A reporter for the IndyStar overheard a conversation between Dr. Bernard and another doctor at an anti-abortion rally and approached Dr. Bernard and asked for comment. The IndyStar ran a story about the girl and the reduction of access to abortions following the Supreme Court’s decision, and the story rapidly became national news. The case was also referenced on multiple occasions by President Biden. Following the publication of the story, Dr. Bernard provided further statements to the media, was interviewed on national TV networks, and was featured in various media articles, in which Dr. Bernard highlighted the real-world impact of the change to federal law on abortions. In those media interviews, Dr. Bernard confirmed that she had performed an abortion procedure on a 10-year-old patient, but did not disclose the name of the patient.\n",
      "Shortly after the publication of the IndyStar story, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita confirmed in a Fox News interview that Dr. Bernard would be investigated. Rokita filed an administrative complaint with the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana alleging Dr. Bernard had violated HIPAA and state law by failing to get written authorization to release patient information, and that Dr. Bernard had failed to immediately report suspected child abuse to local law enforcement in Indianapolis or the Indiana Department of Children Services. Rokita claimed that Dr. Bernard learned about possible child abuse on June 27, 2022, in a telephone call, yet failed to report it until July 2, 2022, the day after the procedure was performed. As such, the child was returned to the custody of the alleged rapist, where she remained until July 6, 2022. Law enforcement later confirmed, with a 99.99% probability, that the rapist was the child’s biological father, who was charged with two counts of rape in July 2022.\n",
      "In a Medical Licencing Board hearing on Thursday, Dr. Bernard’s attorney explained that Dr. Bernard told an IU Health social worker about the case on the same day she received the initial call about the patient, and that discussion was in line with IU Health’s policies. She also confirmed that the abuse was reported on an Indiana state form and that the abuse had already been reported in Ohio where the abuse took place. The IU Health social worker testified that she reported the abuse in Ohio per IU Health policies, as that was where the abuse occurred. Dr. Bernard also confirmed with child protection staffers in Ohio that it was safe for the child to leave with her mother and testified that she did not violate state or federal privacy laws as she did not disclose any identifying information about the patient.\n",
      "At the hearing, Deputy Attorney General Cory Voight asked Dr. Bernard why she had disclosed information about a real patient, rather than providing a hypothetical situation in her media interviews. “I think that it’s incredibly important for people to understand the real-world impacts of the laws of this country about abortion,” said Dr. Bernard in response. “I think it’s important for people to know what patients will have to go through because of legislation that is being passed, and a hypothetical does not make that impact.”\n",
      "Andrew Mahler, a former official at the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights was an expert witness for the state and testified that the disclosures made by Dr. Bernard violated HIPAA, as it was certainly possible that the information disclosed by Dr. Bernard – age, state, and gender – would allow the girl to be identified. Paige Joyner, a privacy compliance officer and former OCR auditor, was a witness for the defense and disagreed with Mahler’s view, testifying that the information Dr. Bernard disclosed was not protected health information and that the disclosure was not a HIPAA violation. IU Health agreed and did not believe the HIPAA Rules had been violated. At the hearing, Dr. Bernard defended her right to speak to the media about medical issues when it is in the public interest and her attorney confirmed that there are no laws that prohibit physicians from speaking with the media.\n",
      "Dr. John Strobel, President of the Medical Licensing Board believed Dr. Bernard disclosed too much information to the IndyStar reporter about the pending abortion and said consent should have been obtained before any information was disclosed. The majority decision of the Medical Licensing Board was the disclosures violated state and federal privacy laws and Dr. Bernard received a $1,000 fine for each of the three privacy violation counts. The Medical Licensing Board found the state had failed to meet the burden for the other two counts on reporting the child abuse and Dr. Bernard being unfit to practice, and therefore did not suspend Dr. Bernard or put her on probation so she is able to continue to practice in Indiana. Dr. Bernard will be given the right to appeal the decision.\n",

      "Cyberattacks on Hospitals Cause Significant Disruption at Neighboring Healthcare Facilities\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 25, 2023\n",
      "A recent study has confirmed that healthcare cyberattacks not only cause disruption at the organization that experiences an attack but also at emergency departments at neighboring hospitals, where patients face longer wait times due to increased patient numbers which place a strain on resources.\n",
      "The study involved a retroactive analysis of two academic emergency departments operated by a healthcare delivery organization (HDO) in San Diego, which were in the vicinity of an unrelated HDO that experienced a ransomware attack. The researchers looked at adult and pediatric patient volume, emergency medical services diversion data, and emergency department stroke care metrics for four weeks prior to the attack, during the attack, and four weeks after the attack.\n",
      "The ransomware attack in question occurred on May 1, 2021, and affected an HDO with 4 acute care hospitals, 19 outpatient facilities, and more than 1,300 combined acute inpatient beds. The attack prevented access to electronic medical records and imaging systems and affected the HDO’s telehealth capabilities. Staff were forced to use pen and paper to record patient information and emergency traffic was redirected to unaffected facilities. The attack caused disruption for 4 weeks, and around 150,000 patient records were compromised.\n",
      "An attack on one hospital will often see patient numbers increase at neighboring hospitals, and the increased volume of patients and resource constraints impact time-sensitive care for health conditions such as acute stroke. The researchers found there were significant disruptions to services at the neighboring healthcare facilities, even though they were not targeted or directly affected by the ransomware attack. Compared to the period before the attack, there was a 15.1% increase in the daily mean emergency department census, a 35.2% increase in mean ambulance arrivals, a 6.7% increase in mean admissions, a 127.8% increase in patients leaving without being seen, a 50.4% increase in visits where patients left against medical advice, and a 47.6% increase in median waiting room times.\n",
      "The researchers chose acute stroke care as an example of a time-sensitive, resource-intensive, technologically dependent, and potentially lifesaving set of complex actions and decisions, that required a readily available multidisciplinary team working in close coordination. The researchers observed a 74.6% increase in stroke code activations and a 113.6% increase in confirmed strokes compared to the pre-attack phase.\n",
      "Since a ransomware attack on one hospital impacts other non-targeted healthcare facilities, the researchers suggest that ransomware and other cyberattacks should be classed as regional disasters. The researchers report no significant difference in door–to–CT scan or acute stroke treatment times, but suggest the disruptions due to ransomware attacks could easily lead to negative patient outcomes. “These findings support the need for coordinated regional cyber disaster planning, further study on the potential patient care effects of cyberattacks, and continued work to build technical health care systems resilient to cyberattacks such as ransomware,” wrong the researchers, who also suggest this should be made a national priority given the increase in cyberattacks on healthcare organizations in recent years.\n",
      "The study – Ransomware Attack Associated With Disruptions at Adjacent Emergency Departments in the US – was conducted by Christian Dameff, MD, MS, Jeffrey Tully, MD, and Theodore C. Chan MD, and was published in JAMA Open Network.\n",

      "CommonSpirit Health Says Ransomware Attack Likely to Cost $160 Million\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 25, 2023\n",
      "CommonSpirit Health has provided an updated estimate on the cost of its October 2022 ransomware attack, which is expected to increase to $160 million. The ransomware attack was detected by CommonSpirit Health on October 2, 2022, forcing systems to be taken offline. The attack affected over 100 current and former CommonSpirit facilities in 13 states. The forensic investigation determined hackers first gained access to its network on September 16, 2022, and were ejected on October 3, 2022. The attackers stole data from two file servers, although they did not gain access to its medical record system. The stolen files contained the protected health information of almost 624,000 patients.\n",
      "CommonSpirit Health operates 143 hospitals and around 2,300 other healthcare facilities in 22 states and is the second-largest non-profit health system in the United States. CommonSpirt’s first quarter results show total revenues from the 3 months to March 31, 2023, of $8.3 billion, and $25.6 billion for the 9 months to March 31. In the first quarter of 2023, CommonSpirit reported $648 million in operating losses and $1.1 million in losses for the 9 months to March 31. Net losses of $231 million and $445 million were reported for the 3- and 9-month periods due to improved investment returns. CommonSpirit said the ransomware attack did not have any impact on the current quarter’s operating results.\n",
      "The ransomware attack was initially estimated to cost around $150 million, but a further $10 million in costs has been added to that figure. The increased cost factors in lost revenues due to business interruption, costs incurred remediating the ransomware attack, and other business-related expenses. In a call with investors, CommonSpirit explained that most of the $160 million is expected to be recovered from underwriters, although recovery of the costs is expected to take some time. CommonSpirit also confirmed in its quarterly report that it is facing a class action lawsuit over the ransomware attack and data breach. The lawsuit was filed in December 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and alleges negligence due to the failure to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect patient data. The lawsuit seeks damages for the plaintiff and class exceeding $5 million, injunctive relief, and legal costs.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 25, 2023\n",
      "In April 2023, Point32Health, the second-largest health insurer in Massachusetts and the parent company of Tufts Health Plan and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, announced it suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in system outages, including the systems that serviced members, accounts, brokers, and providers. The attack was detected on April 17, and systems were rapidly taken offline to contain the breach, although at the time of the announcement it was unclear to what extent, if any, protected health information had been compromised.\n",
      "Point32Health has provided an update on the incident and said it is likely that the protected health information of current and former members of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care plans was stolen in the attack. Point32Health said the forensic investigation confirmed that systems were breached on March 28, 2023, and the attackers maintained access to its systems until April 17, 2023, when the security breach was discovered. During that time the attackers exfiltrated files from its systems that contained personal and protected health information such as names, physical addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, health insurance account information, Social Security numbers, provider taxpayer identification numbers, and clinical information.\n",
      "Point32Health said some of the affected systems, including those used to service members, brokers, and providers remain offline, including the systems that support Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Commercial and Medicare Advantage Stride℠ plans (HMO)/(HMO-POS). Point32Health is working with third-party cybersecurity experts and expects to bring those systems back online in the coming weeks. “We are currently going through the internal IT and business validations. Once this process is complete, alongside our thorough security screenings, some of our processes will become available in a phased fashion,” said Point32Health Director of Public Relations, Kathleen Makela.\n",
      "Point32Health said it has reviewed and enhanced its user access protocols, enhanced vulnerability scanning, identified prioritized IT security improvements, implemented a new Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) security solution, and performed a password reset for all administrative accounts.\n",
      "Evidence has been found to indicate the protected health information of current and former health plan subscribers and their dependents has been compromised, but no reports have been received to date to indicate any misuse of the affected data; however, as a precaution against identity theft and fraud, affected individuals are being offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.\n",
      "Point32Health and its subsidiaries serve more than 2 million individuals in New England, but it is unclear how many of those individuals have been affected.\n",

      "AHA Urges OCR To Reconsider its Guidance on Tracking Technologies\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 24, 2023\n",
      "The American Hospital Association (AHA) has urged the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights to rethink its guidance on online tracking technologies and to stop considering an IP address as a unique identifier under HIPAA with respect to pixels and other website tracking technologies.\n",
      "OCR’s December 2022 guidance was issued in response to the widespread use of tracking technologies on healthcare provider websites. The tracking code, provided by third parties such as Facebook and Google, can be used for a variety of legitimate purposes that benefit healthcare providers and consumers. The tracking technologies record information about website visits, which includes the pages a user visits on the site, as well as options selected from drop-down menus and form data. That naturally can include information about medical conditions, and that information, together with a unique identifier – the user’s IP address – is often transferred to the provider of the tracking technology.\n",
      "In the guidance, OCR explained that the IP address ties health information to an individual and is therefore protected health information subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule as the website visitor is either a past, present, or future patient. The AHA considers this to be a much too broad interpretation  and warns it “will result in significant adverse consequences for hospitals, patients and the public at large,” and suggests “by treating a mere IP address as protected health information under HIPAA, the Online Tracking Guidance will reduce public access to credible health information.”\n",
      "There are many credible uses of tracking technologies that would potentially be lost based on the current guidance. “Analytics technologies allow hospitals to optimize their online presence to reach more members of the community, including members of the community most in need of certain healthcare information,” explained the AHA, while tracking technologies are used to help ensure non-English speakers have access to important health information, provide individuals with information about where healthcare services are located, and social media tools are used to drive traffic to websites containing trustworthy medical information. The AHA points out that tracking technologies need to be used with the help of third-party vendors, and those vendors will typically not sign business associate agreements and be subject to HIPAA.\n",
      "“The Online Tracking Guidance puts hospitals and health systems at risk of serious consequences — including class action lawsuits, HIPAA enforcement actions, or the loss of tens of millions of dollars of existing investments in existing websites, apps and portals — for a problem that ultimately is not of their own making,” explained the AHA. The AHA has urged OCR to consider whether the guidance on online tracking technologies is necessary given the increased privacy protections outlined in the proposed modifications to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, to amend the guidance to better reflect the realities of the online activities by hospitals and health systems, or to seek public feedback before reissuing the guidance.\n",
      "While the AHA has received negative feedback from its members on the tracking technology guidance, feedback on the proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule with respect to reproductive health information has been largely positive. “The prospect of releasing highly sensitive \n",

      "  can result in medical mistrust and the deterioration of the confidential, safe environment that is necessary to quality health care, a functional health care system, and the public’s health generally,” wrote Melinda Reid Hatton, AHA General Counsel and Secretary in the comments for OCR. “If individuals believe that their PHI may be disclosed without their knowledge or consent to initiate criminal, civil, or administrative investigations or proceedings against them or others based primarily upon their receipt of lawful reproductive health care, they are likely to be less open, honest, or forthcoming about their symptoms and medical history.”\n",
      "The AHA and its members believe that the provision of medical care that is lawful in the location where it is provided should not carry adverse legal consequences and that the proposed Privacy Rule changes will enhance provider-patient relationships. With respect to the requirement for entities requesting health information to attest that they are not seeking to use the information to investigate or penalize the lawful provision of health care, the AHA welcomes the amendments, which it considers common sense. However, the AHA suggests other measures to decrease the burden on healthcare providers such as emphasizing in the final rule that hospitals and health systems will not be burdened by having to question the validity of an attester’s statements, provided the statements are reasonably objective. The AHA also suggests OCR should produce a model attestation form, stipulate that attestation forms include the subpoena or administrative order relevant to the legal process, and make it a requirement for requests to be made only for individuals, and never in bulk.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 24, 2023\n",
      "The Amazon-owned online pharmacy, PillPack, has recently started notifying 19,032 customers that some of their protected health information was compromised in a cyberattack in April. Unauthorized customer account activity was detected by PillPack on April 3, 2023, and the investigation revealed customer accounts had been accessed by an unauthorized third party between April 2 and April 6, 2023. The compromised accounts contained names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Approximately 3,600 of the accounts also included prescription information.\n",
      "The forensic investigation confirmed that the usernames and passwords used to access the accounts were not stolen from PillPack and had most likely been obtained in a breach at another platform where the same usernames and passwords were used. These credential-stuffing attacks can only occur when usernames and passwords have been used on multiple platforms. PillPack has not identified any misuse of customer data, and the types of information in the accounts are not sufficient to be used for identity theft. However, victims of the breach could be subject to phishing attempts to obtain further information. PillPack confirmed that the breach was limited to PillPack and notification letters have been mailed to affected individuals.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 24, 2023\n",
      "A medical management company has been fined $550,000 by the New York Attorney General for failing to prevent a cyberattack that exposed the personal and protected health information of 1.2 million individuals, including 428,000 New Yorkers.\n",
      "Professional Business Systems Inc, which does business as Practicefirst Medical Management Solutions and PBS Medcode Corp, had its systems hacked in November 2020. The threat actor exfiltrated sensitive data from its systems and then deployed ransomware to encrypt files. As proof of data theft and to pressure Practicefirst into paying the ransom, files were uploaded to the threat actor’s dark web data leak site. The leaked data included screenshots of 13 patients’ protected health information. Practicefirst’s investigation confirmed the threat actor exfiltrated approximately 79,000 files from its systems, which contained names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, medication information, and financial information.\n",
      "The investigation conducted by the Office of the New York Attorney General determined that the hacker gained initial access to Practicefirst’s systems by exploiting a critical vulnerability in its firewall. The firewall provider released an updated version of the firewall software in January 2019, but Practicefirst failed to apply the update. Practicefirst did not conduct penetration tests or vulnerability scans, or perform other security tests that would have highlighted the vulnerability before it was exploited.  The protected health information stored on its systems was also not encrypted. The New York Attorney General determined that these failures violated state law and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n",
      "Practicefirst agreed to settle the alleged violations of HIPAA and state law. In addition to the financial penalty, Practicefirst has agreed to strengthen its data security practices and will offer affected individuals complimentary credit monitoring services. The data security measures agreed upon as part of the settlement include the development, implementation, and maintenance of a comprehensive information security program, encryption for health information stored on its systems, implementation of a patch management system with timely patching of vulnerabilities, regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, and updates to its data collection, retention, and disposal practices.\n",
      "“When a person is seeking medical care, their last concern should be the security of their personal information,” said Attorney General Letitia James. “Each and every company charged with maintaining and handling patient data should take their responsibility to protect personal information, particularly health records, seriously. New Yorkers can trust that when companies fail at their duty, my office will step in to hold them accountable.\n",

      "There was a 17.5% month-over-month fall in the number of reported healthcare data breaches with 52 breaches of 500 or more records reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) – less than the 12-month average of 58 breaches per month, and one less than in April 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the largest healthcare data breaches of the year was reported in April, but there was still a significant month-over-month reduction in breached records, which fell by 30.7% to 4,425,891 records. The total is less than the 12-month average of 4.9 million records a month, although more than twice the number of records that were breached in April 2022.\n",

      "Largest Healthcare Data Breaches Reported in April 2023\n",
      "As previously mentioned, April saw a major data breach reported that affected 3,037,303 individuals – The third largest breach to be reported by a single HIPAA-covered entity so far this year, and the 19th largest breach to be reported by a single HIPAA-regulated entity to date.  The breach occurred at the HIPAA business associate, NationsBenefits Holdings, and was a data theft and extortion attack by the Clop ransomware group involving the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT solution.  8 of the month’s 21 breaches of 10,000 or more records were due to these Clop attacks, including the top 5 breaches in April. Brightline Inc. was also hit hard by those attacks, which were reported separately for each covered entity client (9 reports). Together, the attacks on Brightline involved the PHI of more than 964,000 individuals.\n",
      "18 of the 21 breaches of 10,000 or more records were hacking incidents. The remaining three breaches were unauthorized disclosures of protected health information, one due to tracking technologies and the other two due to mailing errors. While ransomware and data theft/extortion attacks dominated the breach reports, phishing, business email compromise, and other email account breaches are common, with 5 of the top 21 breaches involving hacked email accounts. End-user security awareness training is recommended to reduce susceptibility to these attacks and multifactor authentication should be implemented on all email accounts, ideally using phishing-resistant multifactor authentication.\n",

      "Causes of April 2023 Healthcare Data Breaches\n",
      "Hacking and other IT incidents continue to dominate the breach reports, accounting for 36 of the month’s breaches (69.2%) and the vast majority of the breached records. Across those incidents, 4,077,019 healthcare records were exposed or stolen – 92.1% of the records that were breached in April. The average breach size was 119,914 records and the median breach size was 9,675 records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ransomware attacks continue to be conducted by there has been a notable shift in tactics, with many ransomware gangs opting for data theft and extortion without encrypting files, as was the case with the attacks conducted by the Clop ransomware group which exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT solution. The BianLian threat group has previously conducted attacks using ransomware, but this year has been primarily conducting extortion-only attacks, which are quieter and faster. 12 of the month’s breaches (40%) involved hacked email accounts, highlighting the importance of security awareness training and multifactor authentication.\n",
      "There were 13 unauthorized access/disclosure incidents in April, including a 58K-record incident involving tracking technologies that transferred sensitive data to third parties such as Google, instances of paper records not being secured, and PHI that had been exposed over the Internet. Across those 13 breaches, 105,155 records were impermissibly disclosed. The average breach size was 8,089 records and the median breach size was 1,304 records.\n",
      "There were two theft incidents involving 3,321 records in total and one improper disposal incident. The improper disposal incident was reported as involving 501 records – a placeholder commonly used to meet the Breach Notification Rule reporting deadline when the total number of individuals affected has yet to be determined.  As the chart below shows, the majority of incidents involved ePHI stored on network servers and in email accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where Did the Breaches Occur?\n",
      "The raw data on the OCR breach portal shows the reporting entity, which in some cases is a HIPAA-covered entity when the breach actually occurred at a business associate. The breach portal shows 31 data breaches were reported by healthcare providers, 8 by health plans, and 13 by business associates. The charts below are based on where the breach occurred, rather than the entity that reported the data breach, to better reflect the extent to which data breaches are occurring at business associates.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Geographical Distribution of April 2023 Healthcare Data Breaches\n",
      "Data breaches of 500 or more records were reported by HIPAA-regulated entities in 25 states and Puerto Rico, with California the worst affected state with 16 breaches, 9 of which were the same incident that was reported separately for each client by Brightline Inc., which is why the breach count was so high for California this month.\n",

      "Updated Pennsylvania Breach of Personal Information Notification Act Now in Effect\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 23, 2023\n",
      "the 2022 update to the Pennsylvania Breach of Personal Information Notification Act (BPINA) is now in effect. The update broadened the definition of personal information to include medical information, health insurance information, and usernames in combination with a password or security question/answer that allows an account to be accessed. The update to BPINA was signed into law on November 3, 2022, and took effect on May 2, 2023.\n",
      "Medical information is defined as any individually identifiable information contained in an individual’s current or historical record of medical history or medical treatment or diagnosis created by a health care professional. Health insurance information is defined as a health insurance policy number or subscriber identification number in combination with an access code or other medical information that permits misuse of an individual’s health insurance benefits.\n",
      "The updated BPINA applies to state agencies, political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, and individuals or businesses that do business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A state agency includes any agency, board, commission, authority, or department of the Commonwealth and the General Assembly. The update also applies to state agency contractors, which are persons, businesses, subcontractors, or third-party subcontractors that have a contract with a state agency for goods or services, which requires access to personal information.\n",
      "The updated BPINA requires notification to be issued when unencrypted and unredacted personal information is reasonably believed to have been accessed and acquired by an unauthorized individual, and if encrypted data is breached and the key to decrypt the data is also reasonably believed to have been obtained. No time frame is stipulated for issuing notifications, other than requiring them to be issued “without unreasonable delay”. When a breach occurs at a vendor, the vendor is required to notify the entity that provided the data, and that entity is responsible for making determinations and discharging any remaining notification duties.\n",
      "Notifications must be issued by mail to the last known address, by telephone if the individuals concerned can be reasonably expected to be contacted by phone and are not required to provide personal information for verification, or via email, if a previous business relationship exists and a valid email address is known for that individual.  Electronic notifications are permitted if the notice directs the user to promptly change their password and security question or answer or to take other steps appropriate to protect that individual’s online account, provided sufficient contact information is held to allow the electronic notice to be served.\n",
      "Any entity that is required by law to comply with HIPAA or the HITECH Act will be determined to be compliant with the updated BPINA provided they are compliant with the privacy and security standards of HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as will any state agency or state agency contractor that is compliant with the breach notification requirements or procedures established by the entity’s, state agency’s or state agency’s contractor’s primary state or functional federal regulator.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 23, 2023\n",
      "Apria Healthcare LLC, a Minneapolis, MN-based provider of home medical equipment for sleep apnea, has recently sent notifications to individuals about a historic data breach. Apria was alerted about unauthorized access to some of its systems on September 1, 2021. According to the breach notification letters, steps were immediately taken to mitigate the incident, and Apria worked with a third-party forensics team and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The investigation confirmed its systems were accessed by an unauthorized individual between April 5, 2019, and May 7, 2019, and again from August 27, 2021, to October 10, 2021. The investigation determined that access was gained to its systems primarily to obtain funds from Apria, rather than to obtain the personal information of patients or employees.\n",
      "While the investigation confirmed that some files containing protected health information were accessed, no evidence of data theft was found; however, data theft could not be ruled out. According to the breach notification sent to the Maine Attorney General, the files on its system that were potentially accessed contained the personal and protected health information of 1,869,598 individuals. The information involved varied from individual to individual and may have included personal, medical, health insurance information, and financial information, and for a limited number of individuals, Social Security numbers.\n",
      "Apria said it has implemented additional security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future and affected individuals have been offered one year of complimentary credit monitoring services through Kroll. It is unclear why it took 20 months from the discovery of the intrusion for breach notification letters to be issued.\n",
      "Illinois Department of Human Services Reports Breach of Benefits Eligibility System\n",
      "The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (IHFS) and the Illinois Department of Human Services IDHS have recently announced that unauthorized individuals gained access to the Manage My Case (MMC) portal of the state Application for Benefits Eligibility (ABE) system, which is used for determining eligibility for State-funded medical benefits programs (Medicaid), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).\n",
      "Unauthorized accounts were created in the ABE system, which accessed and linked to existing customer MMC accounts by using customers’ personal information that had been stolen from another source. The information exposed as a result of the breach included names, social security numbers, recipient identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and income information.\n",
      "The portal has been secured and unauthorized access has been blocked. 50,839 individuals who applied for or are receiving benefits through the ABE systems have been affected.\n",
      "Link Audiology Reports Email Account Breach\n",
      "Link Audiology LLC, a Silverdale, WA-based provider of audiology services, has recently confirmed that the protected health information of up to 7,200 current and former patients has been exposed due to the hacking of an employee email account. The compromised account contained email communications between Link Audiology s and a company that was used to handle billing to insurance companies and patients.\n",
      "The purpose of the attack appears to have been to divert payroll rather than obtain patient information. The email account breach was detected on April 4, 2023, when a fraudulent payroll submission appeared on the company checking account. The investigation revealed the email account was compromised on March 20, 2023, and that the account was again accessed between March 29, 2023, and April 4, 2023. The email account contained copies of personal and insurance checks and copies of insurance Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms.\n",
      "A password reset was performed for all email accounts and two-factor authentication was enabled. Internal protocols have also been updated to limit the exposure of data in the event of a similar attack in the future. The decision was taken to send notification letters to all individuals in its database as a precaution since it was not possible to determine if any patient information had been accessed.\n",
      "Email Account Breach Impacts Patients of Beltone Hearing Aid Centers\n",
      "Grohler Hearing Aid Center, Inc, doing business as Beltone Hearing Aid Centers, has notified 5,272 individuals about the exposure of some of their protected health information. On March 1, 2023, an employee received a fraudulent request for payment from one of its vendors. The investigation revealed an unauthorized third party had accessed an employee’s Microsoft 365 online account on February 21, 2023, when the employee responded to a phishing email.\n",
      "The unauthorized individual was discovered to have accessed documents in the account that included the full names, internal patient identification numbers, and insurance providers of 50 patients. It was not possible to rule out access to other patients’ protected health information that was present in other emails in the account, although evidence of data access and data theft was not found. Those emails contained information such as patient names, treatment information (including the hearing aid worn by the patient), address, date of birth, driver’s license number, Social Security Number, insurance claims information, patient identification numbers, health information, and credit card/bank account information. Additional security measures have been implemented and further training has been provided to the workforce.\n",

      "Bipartisan Legislation Introduced to Address Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Skill Gaps\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 22, 2023\n",
      "New bipartisan legislation has recently been introduced to help address the current shortage of cybersecurity skills at rural hospitals. The Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act was introduced by Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), committee member.\n",
      "Cyberattacks on healthcare organizations have increased significantly over the past few years. These attacks cause considerable disruption to patient care and can put lives at risk and while health systems have increased investment in cybersecurity, many small and rural hospitals lack the necessary resources and struggle to hire skilled cybersecurity professionals. At a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, cybersecurity experts testified about the current healthcare cybersecurity challenges. Kate Pierce, former CIO and CISO at North County Hospital in Vermont and executive at Fortified Health Security said cybercriminals have shifted their focus and are now actively targeting small and rural hospitals. Large health systems have implemented advanced cybersecurity measures and employ large cybersecurity teams to manage their sophisticated defenses, but there is a large disparity in cybersecurity spending at small and rural hospitals, which tend to have much weaker defenses.\n",
      "“A basic security measure like 24/7 monitoring of systems is “pie-in-the-sky” for these organizations,” explained Pierce at the hearing. “Despite all the guidance, recommendations and services provided over the past few years by HSCC, 405(d), H-ISAC, CISA, and other organizations, I have found that the vast majority of small and rural hospitals are unaware of these resources, and too overwhelmed to take advantage of these valuable tools.”\n",
      "The Rural Hospital Cybersecurity Enhancement Act requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity workforce development strategy for healthcare facilities that provide inpatient and outpatient care services in non-urbanized areas. The strategy should include public-private partnerships, the development of curricula and training resources, and policy recommendations. The bill requires the Director of CISA to create instructional materials for rural hospitals to train staff on fundamental cybersecurity measures, and for the Department of Homeland Security to report annually to congressional committees on updates to the strategy and any programs that have been implemented.\n",
      "“Ransomware attacks against hospitals and health care systems that compromise sensitive medical information and disrupt patient care must be stopped. Unfortunately, small and rural hospitals often lack the resources to invest in cybersecurity defenses and staff to prevent these breaches,” said Senator Peters. “This bipartisan legislation will require the federal government to ensure our most vulnerable health care providers have the necessary tools to protect patient information and provide lifesaving care even as criminal hackers continue to target their networks.”\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 20, 2023\n",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has conducted two rounds of HIPAA audits on covered entities and business associates to assess compliance with the HIPAA Rules. OCR investigates all breaches of 500 or more records to determine if they were caused by noncompliance, and may also initiate compliance reviews for smaller breaches and in response to complaints about potential HIPAA violations. If you are contacted by OCR and told you have been selected for an audit or compliance review, it is natural to be concerned but there is no need to panic if you are prepared.\n",
      "On April 27, 2023, Compliancy Group is hosting a webinar where attendees will learn about the ins and outs of OCR audits and how you should respond if you are selected for an audit or compliance review. Compliancy Group will take you through the steps you need to take to ensure everything is aligned and fully documented, which will allow you to respond quickly and efficiently to any document requests and will ensure you are properly prepared for an on-site inspection. During the webinar, Compliancy Group will provide real-life examples of audits and, by the end of the webinar, you should have peace of mind that if you are ever audited for HIPAA compliance, you will be well prepared and your business will be protected.\n",
      "The webinar will be hosted by Liam Degnan, Director of Strategic Initiatives, Compliancy Group. Liam Degnan has 8+ years of experience in risk management, SaaS sales, and regulatory compliance in the healthcare space. As Compliancy Group’s Director of Strategic Initiatives, he advises healthcare decision-makers, behavioral health providers, and HIPAA business associates and speaks on a variety of platforms and topics, with an emphasis on simplifying the complex HIPAA regulations.\n",

      "Is Qualtrics HIPAA Compliant?\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 19, 2023\n",
      "The issue with answering the question is Qualtrics HIPAA compliant is that, although the “experience management” platform appears to support HIPAA compliance, configuring and using the platform in a HIPAA compliant manner looks more complicated than some Covered Entities will be comfortable with.\n",
      "For those who struggle with fancy terminology, Qualtrics is an online platform that enables businesses to create and send surveys, obtain customer/employee feedback, and address satisfaction issues using analytics and AI-powered automation. As an engagement and response tool, Qualtrics is a very advanced option. But is Qualtrics HIPAA compliant?\n",
      "Certainly, Qualtrics appears to be HIPAA compliant in its role as a Business Associate to a Covered Entity. It has multiple security certifications – including self-certified compliance with the HiTRUST CSF Framework – and is willing to enter into a Business Associate Agreement with a Covered Entity if the platform is going to be used for collecting, storing, or transmitting PHI.\n",
      "Qualtrics doesn’t provide previews of its Business Associate Agreements, but the draft Contractor Agreement for businesses Qualtrics might share PHI with is very comprehensive and covers everything required by the Administrative Simplification provisions. Assuming the Business Associate Agreement between Covered Entities and Qualtrics is equally as comprehensive, there should be no problem with clarifying Covered Entities’ and Qualtrics’ compliance obligations.\n",
      "Can Qualtrics be Used in Compliance with HIPAA?\n",
      "This is where the issue with HIPAA compliance exists. As mentioned previously, Qualtrics is a very advanced experience management platform. However, rather than explaining the platform’s capabilities – and how to use them – in a language people might understand, the limited information on the web site is garnished with fancy terminology. This can make it difficult to configure and use Qualtrics in compliance with HIPAA.\n",
      "There is a rich resource library that contains product demonstrations, and you can also find demos on YouTube that don’t require you to register first. Both sources demonstrate that, if you don’t know what you are doing when using the platform, the range of options is complicated to navigate – potentially resulting in configuration challenges, user problems, project delays, and incomplete data analyses.\n",
      "To help overcome the issue, Qualtrics has an online resource library with plenty of “how to” pages; but, again, we get the feeling you already have to be familiar with the software – and understand the terminology – to benefit from the advice offered. Phone, email, and chat customer service is also available depending on which level of plan you subscribe to, but the company’s live support services get very poor reviews on user-verified review sites.\n",
      "Limited Use Cases Suggest Other Solutions May be More Viable\n",
      "Like most online survey software, Qualtrics can be used to gain insights into patients’ health habits, track the effectiveness of patient safety programs, and solicit feedback from members of the workforce. Provided the platform is configured and used in compliance with HIPAA when PHI is being collected, stored, or transmitted, the platform can be an asset for these use cases.\n",
      "However, in order to appear more valuable to healthcare providers than competing online survey software, Qualtrics also suggests additional use cases that are unrealistic – for example, solving the nationwide nursing shortage and diagnosing patients’ illnesses remotely with no reference to each patient’s medical history. Other examples tend to have an overreliance on the authenticity of customer reviews to prove a point.\n",
      "In conclusion, Qualtrics is a HIPAA compliant platform that might be a nice toy to have, but it is an expensive toy that could create compliance issues due to the complexity of navigating the platform. Additionally, concerns exist about the steep learning curve, reportedly poor customer support, and limited use cases which suggest other solutions may be more viable. Certainly, simpler survey platforms which are easier to understand are less likely to be responsible for inadvertent HIPAA violations.\n",

      "FTC Proposes Changes to Modernize the Health Breach Notification Rule\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 19, 2023\n",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has proposed changes to the Health Breach Notification Rule to strengthen the applicability of the Rule to health apps and other emerging direct-to-consumer technologies that collect, store, and transmit identifiable health data.\n",
      "There has been an explosion of health apps and connected devices that collect health data, and those apps and devices are collecting vast amounts of health data. There are also incentives for companies that collect health data to disclose that information to third parties for advertising and other purposes. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires health data to be safeguarded, places restrictions on uses and disclosures of health data, and if a data breach occurs, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires notifications to be issued. While health apps and connected devices may collect health data that would be classed as Protected Health Information under HIPAA if collected by a HIPAA-regulated entity, most health apps and connected devices are not covered under HIPAA.\n",
      "The FTC Health Breach Notification Rule applies to vendors of personal health records (PHR) and related entities that are not covered by HIPAA and requires those companies to issue notifications to consumers, the FTC, and the media in the event of a breach of identifiable health data. When a data breach occurs at a third-party service provider to vendors of PHRs and PHR-related entities, the Health Breach Notification Rule requires those entities to issue notifications to vendors and PHR-related entities. The Health Breach Notification Rule has been in effect for a decade, but the FTC has only just started enforcing compliance. Since December 2022, the has taken two enforcement actions against entities alleged to have violated the Health Breach Notification Rule – GoodRx and Easy Healthcare (Premom) –  both of which were found to have failed to issue timely notifications about breaches of identifiable health data.\n",
      "In September 2021, the FTC issued a policy statement confirming the Health Breach Notification Rule applies to health apps and connected devices that collect, use, or transmit consumer health information. The FTC has reviewed the comments received about the policy statement and has determined that the Health Breach Notification Rule needs to be modernized to clarify its applicability to health apps, connected devices, and other direct-to-consumer technologies.\n",
      "The proposed updates include a change to the definition of “PHR identifiable health information,” and new definitions have been added for “health care provider” and “health care services or supplies.” The definition of “PHR related entity” has been revised to make it clear that only entities that access or send unsecured PHR identifiable health information to a personal health record — rather than entities that access or send any information to a personal health record — qualify as PHR related entities. The FTC has also clarified what it means for a personal health record to draw PHR identifiable health information from multiple sources. The proposed update makes it clear that a “breach of security” includes the unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health information that occurs as a result of a data security breach or unauthorized disclosure.\n",
      "The FTC has also authorized the expanded use of email and other electronic means as a way of providing clear and effective notice of a breach to consumers, and the required content of notifications has also been expanded. Notifications will need to include information about the potential harm that can be caused by the breach, and notifications must include the names of any third parties who might have acquired unsecured personally identifiable health information.\n",
      "The comment period on the proposed changes is 60 days from the date of publication of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register.\n",

      "$200,000 Penalty for Impermissible Sharing of Premom App Users’ Health Data\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 19, 2023\n",
      "Easy Healthcare, the developer and distributor of the Premom Ovulation Tracker (Premom) app, has agreed to settle an FTC complaint that alleged violations of the FTC Act and Health Breach Notification Rule related to the sharing of app users’ health data with third parties without consent.\n",
      "The Premom app allows users to track their periods and ovulation cycles. The app allows users to upload pictures of ovulation test strips that the app analyses to predict the user’s next ovulation cycle and the app allows users to upload health data from other devices and apps. The app has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of women, and between 2017 and 2020, the terms and conditions of use stated, “We do not, and will not, ever sell any information about users’ health to third parties, nor do we share it for advertising purposes.” During that period, the FTC alleged the Premom app transmitted the sensitive health information of app users to third-party advertisers without user consent.\n",
      "The FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule ensures entities not covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) face accountability for breaches of consumers’ sensitive health data. The Rule requires notifications to be issued to consumers when there has been a breach of individually identifiable health information, and in September 2021, the FTC issued a policy statement confirming that developers of health apps have a responsibility to secure any collected health data and must prevent unauthorized access.\n",
      "According to the FTC complaint, Easy Healthcare told app users that their health data would not be shared with third parties without their knowledge or consent and falsely claimed the information it shared with third parties was non-identifiable, and would only be used for internal analytics. The FTC found that since 2018, Easy Healthcare shared Premom user data with Google LLC and the marketing firm AppsFlyers Inc, and between 2018 and 2020, Premom user data was shared with two Chinese mobile analytics companies – Jiguang (aka Aurora Mobile Ltd) and Umeng, and no effort was made by Easy Healthcare to restrict the uses of users’ health data by those companies. As such, the companies could use the data for a broad range of purposes, including advertising. In addition to health data, numbers unique to each mobile device (IMEI numbers) were also shared, along with precise geolocation data. The data sharing only stopped when the Google Play Store informed Easy Healthcare that the data sharing violated Play Store policies.\n",
      "The FTC determined that Easy Healthcare failed to implement reasonable privacy and data security measures, in violation of the FTC Act. The disclosures meant Easy Healthcare was required to notify app users, the FTC, and the media. The FTC determined that timely and proper notice was not provided, in violation of the Health Breach Notification Rule. “Premom broke its promises and compromised consumers’ privacy,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “We will vigorously enforce the Health Breach Notification Rule to defend consumer’s health data from exploitation. Companies collecting this information should be aware that the FTC will not tolerate health privacy abuses.”\n",
      "If the order is approved by the court, Easy Healthcare will pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000 to the Treasurer of the United States. A $100,000 settlement was also agreed with the states of Connecticut, Oregon, and the District of Columbia, which assisted the FTC with the investigation. “Given the intimate health data that apps like Premom collect and what that may reveal about when a pregnancy starts or stops, it is critical that user information is kept safe and private,” said Attorney General Tong. “Our settlement forces Easy Healthcare to adopt strict privacy requirements to ensure that its users’ information is appropriately protected.”\n",
      "Easy Healthcare has also been ordered to cease sharing personal health data with third parties for advertising purposes and must contact the third parties that were sent user data and request that information is deleted.  Easy Healthcare has also agreed to make improvements to its privacy and security practices and conduct regular privacy and security audits.\n",
      "Easy Healthcare agreed to settle the case with the FTC to avoid the time and expense of litigation, and the decision to settle is not an admission of wrongdoing. “Rest assured that we do not, and will not, ever sell any information about users’ health to third parties, nor do we share it for advertising purposes. At Easy Healthcare, we adhere to the promises we make to our users. Protecting users’ data is a high priority, which is why we have always been transparent with and cooperated fully throughout the FTC’s review of our privacy program. We remain committed to these principles,” said Easy Healthcare in a statement.\n",

      "Will a HIPAA Violation Show Up on a Background Check?\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 19, 2023\n",
      "Whether or not a HIPAA violation will show up on a background check depends on the nature of the violation, the consequences of the violation, and the motive for the violation. While it is currently rare for a HIPAA violation to show up on a background check, this may change due to a proposed update to the Privacy Rule. \n",
      "There are many different types of HIPAA violations. Some have minimal impact and no long-lasting consequences – i.e., an accidental disclosure of PHI that is overheard, but nothing comes of it – whereas others can have a major impact on an organization and serious consequences for individuals affected by the violation – i.e., the deliberate misuse of login credential that exposes a PHI database.\n",
      "Most employee HIPAA violations are addressed according to a Covered Entity’s sanctions policy. Employees responsible for minor violations will likely be sanctioned with verbal or written warnings and additional HIPAA training. Those responsible for repeated or serious violations could be sanctioned with a suspension or termination of employment, or loss of license to practice.\n",
      "A suspension, termination, or loss of license would be recorded in an employment record, but would not show up on a background check unless the motive for the HIPAA violation was the knowing and wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information without authorization – which is not only a violation of HIPAA, but also a violation of §1177 of the Social Security Act.\n",
      "When a HIPAA Violation Will Show Up on a Background Check\n",
      "When a HIPAA violation is also a violation of the Social Security Act, an employer is required to report the violation to a law enforcement agency as well as HHS’ Office for Civil Rights. The case will be referred to the Department of Justice, who will pursue a criminal conviction for the violation. If successful, the penalties for criminally violating HIPAA are:\n",
      "\n",
      "For wrongfully and knowingly violating §1177 of the Social Security Act – a fine of up to $50,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to one year.\n",
      "If the offence is committed under false pretenses (i.e., with someone else’s login credentials) – a fine of up to $100,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to five years.\n",
      "If the offence is committed for personal gain, malicious harm, or a commercial advantage – a fine of up to $250,000 and/or a prison sentence of up to ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the sentence imposed, the HIPAA violation, the consequences of the HIPAA violation, and the penalty for the HIPAA violation will become public record and will show up on a background check. This will undoubtedly prevent a person obtaining employment in a healthcare role, and likely prevent employment in any other position in which the person will have access to sensitive data.\n",
      "The Proposed Update to the Privacy Rule\n",
      "In April 2023, HHS’ Office for Civil Rights published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register. The Notice is in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women`s Health Organization, which led to many states introducing anti-abortion legislation and women having to cross state lines to have terminations in states where abortions are still legal.\n",
      "State with anti-abortion legislation cannot prevent women crossing state lines to have a termination, but some have introduced further legislation criminalizing the act of assisting with or facilitating a termination procedure. Because this could lead to the disclosure of PHI to pursue a criminal conviction relating to a medical procedure that was legal in the state it was administered, HHS` Office for Civil Rights is proposing an update to the Privacy Rule.\n",
      "The update would add a new category of uses and disclosures (“attestation”) to those that already exist (“required”, “permitted”, “opportunity to agree”, and “authorized”). Thereafter, certain types of PHI considered more sensitive than other types could only be used or disclosed if the recipient attests the PHI will not be further used or disclosed for a prohibited purpose (in this case to pursue a criminal conviction relating to a legal procedure).\n",
      "If finalized, the new category would not only apply to PHI relating to terminations, but to all reproductive healthcare – including contraception, fertility treatment, and miscarriages. The category could also be used to align the Privacy Rule more closely with 42 CFR Part 2 (the confidentiality of substance use disorder medical records), and protect other types of sensitive data from misuse or disclosures that contradict Health and Human Services’ messaging.\n",
      "How the Update Could Increase §1177 Violations\n",
      "The reason the update could increase §1177 violations is that, if a person to whom sensitive PHI is disclosed under an attestation subsequently uses or discloses the PHI for a prohibited purpose, they will be considered to have knowingly and wrongfully disclosed individually identifiable health information without authorization.\n",
      "Importantly, not only will the person who gave a false attestation be guilty of a §1177 violation, but the Covered Entity (or employee of a Covered Entity) who disclosed the information may also be guilty of a §1177 violation if they knew – or should have known – that sensitive PHI was going to be used or disclosed for a prohibited purpose.\n",
      "If an employee of a Covered Entity is found guilty of a §1177 violation, this will also be a HIPAA violation that will show up on a background check. Therefore – if the proposed update to the Privacy Rule is finalized – not only should Covered Entities make sure policies and procedures reflect the new category of uses and disclosures, but also that all members of the workforce are trained on the updated policies and procedures to prevent avoidable violations of HIPAA.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 18, 2023\n",
      "The Edinburg, TX-based internal medicine specialists, ASAS Health, have recently notified 25,527 individuals about a hacking incident that exposed some of their sensitive protected health information. Suspicious network activity was detected on March 9, 2023, and immediate action was taken to secure the network. A forensic investigation confirmed that hackers had access to parts of its network that contained patient information. The breach notifications do not disclose the nature of the incident or for how long the hackers had access to its systems.\n",
      "ASUS Health said it was not possible to definitively determine if patient data was accessed or stolen, but data may have been compromised. The review of the affected files confirmed they contained information such as names, date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, disability codes, Medicare ID numbers, and health plan carrier information.\n",
      "The breach report that was sent to the Maine Attorney General indicates credit monitoring services have been offered. Affected individuals have also been advised to monitor their accounts and report any suspicious activity, and to be wary of phishing attempts and emails and documents allegedly sent from ASUS Health. ASUS Health said it will continue to refine its security protocols and maintain a robust information security program.\n",
      "Methodist Family Health Affected by Data Breach at Business Associate\n",
      "Little Rock, AR-based Methodist Family Health has confirmed that patient data was exposed in a security breach at one of its business associates. The business associate was used to provide pharmacy services and was provided with patient data to perform the contracted duties.  The business associate detected a security breach on March 6, 2023, and the investigation confirmed its systems were accessed on March 4, 2023.\n",
      "Methodist Family Health has confirmed that the unauthorized access has been blocked and additional security measures have been deployed to prevent similar incidents in the future. The compromised documents contained information such as names, addresses, birth dates, admission/treatment dates, account numbers, diagnoses, service charges, and medication information.  The breach has recently been reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights as affecting 5,259 individuals.\n",
      "People Incorporated of Sequoyah County Suffers Ransomware Attack\n",
      "People Incorporated of Sequoyah County (People Inc), a Sallisaw, OK-based provider of behavioral health, addiction recovery, and anger management services, has discovered an unauthorized third party gained access to the sensitive data of 8,725 current and former patients in a recent ransomware attack.\n",
      "The incident was detected by People Inc on March 6, 2023, and the forensic investigation confirmed that an unauthorized individual had access to certain systems between March 2, and March 6, 2023, during which time files were exfiltrated that contained patient data.  The files contained names, Social Security numbers, care plans, scheduling information, and billing information.\n",
      "Notification letters have recently been mailed and affected individuals have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. People Inc said it has strengthened system security to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n",
      "Email Account Breach at Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center\n",
      "Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center in Illinois have notified 1,700 patients that some of their personal and health information has potentially been compromised due to an email security breach. The security incident was detected on March 6, 2023, and the investigation confirmed that an email account had been accessed by an unauthorized individual.\n",
      "A third-party digital forensics firm was engaged to investigate the incident and found no evidence of data transfers from the email account; however, unauthorized access to patient information could not be ruled out. The review of the account revealed the email account contained partially de-identified PHI concerning Lake County residents who may have had a communicable disease or a disease that was part of a cluster or outbreak that was investigated by the health department between April 23, 2012, and March 6, 2023.\n",
      "The exposed information included one or more of the following types of information: names, addresses, zip codes, date of birth, gender, phone number, email address, medical record number, diagnoses or conditions, lab results, and other treatment information. Additional email security safeguards have now been implemented and further cyber security training has been provided to the workforce.\n",
      "Oyate Health Center Notifies Patients About Impermissible PHI Disclosure\n",
      "Oyate Health Center in South Dakota has discovered an unintended impermissible disclosure of the protected health information of 575 patients. The information related to pharmacy visits between August 31, 2021, and September 8, 2021.\n",
      "When Oyate Health Center moved to a new clinic location, boxes of surplus supplies were donated to community organizations. On March 7, 2023, one of those organizations opened one of the boxes and found a weekly pharmacy visit report, which was a list of patients with their chart number, date of visit, and a diagnosis code related to the prescription they were filling. The list was seen by two people at the non-profit organization, and the list was then locked in a secure location until it could be collected.\n",
      "Under HIPAA this is classed as an impermissible disclosure. Oyate Health Center said it has no reason to believe the list was viewed by anyone else and does not believe the information has been missed. In response to the incident, new internal controls, policies, and procedures have been implemented and the affected individuals have been notified.\n",

      "HIPAA Enforcement by State Attorneys General\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 18, 2023\n",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights is the main enforcer of HIPAA compliance; however, state Attorneys General also play a role in enforcing compliance with the Rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n",
      "The Health Information Technology for Clinical and Economic Health (HITECH) Act gave state attorneys general the authority to bring civil actions on behalf of state residents who have been impacted by violations of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and they can obtain damages on behalf of state residents. The Connecticut Attorney General was the first to exercise this right in 2010 against Health Net Inc. for the loss of an unencrypted hard drive containing the electronic protected health information of 1.5 million individuals and for delayed breach notifications. The case was settled for $250,000. The Vermont Attorney General followed suit with a similar action against Health Net in 2011 that was settled for $55,000, and Indiana brought a civil action against Wellpoint Inc. in 2011 that was settled for $100,000.\n",
      "State attorneys general HIPAA cases were relatively rare occurrences, with only 11 settlements reached with HIPAA-covered entities and business associates to resolve HIPAA violations between 2010 and 2015. HIPAA enforcement by state attorneys general was stepped up in 2017 with 5 settlements and again in 2018 when 12 cases resulted in financial penalties for violations of the HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "In 2019 and 2020, a total of just 5 cases resulted in financial penalties, although those penalties were sizeable, with four of the five cases being multistate actions against HIPAA-covered entities and business associates where several state attorneys general participated in the actions. These multistate actions allow state attorneys general to pool their resources and investigate potential violations of HIPAA and state laws more efficiently.\n",
      "When civil actions are brought against covered entities or business associates by state Attorneys General, they are separate from any Office for Civil Rights actions. It is possible that multiple penalties will be imposed. Several data breaches have resulted in settlements being reached at both the federal and state level. Community Health Systems/CHSPSC, Anthem Inc., Premera Blue Cross, Aetna, Cottage Health System, University of Rochester Medical Center, and Medical Informatics Engineering have all settled cases with OCR and separate cases with state attorneys general to resolve potential HIPAA violations.\n",
      "In many of the state AG enforcement actions below, the financial penalties resolve violations of federal (HIPAA) and/or state laws. Over the years there have been several cases where HIPAA Rules have been violated, but the decision was taken to bring actions for violations of the equivalent provisions in state laws. The cases detailed below include cases where the HIPAA Rules have been violated, but action has been taken for the violation of state laws.\n",

New Jersey also participated in a joint investigation into the data breach at American Medical Collection Agency (AMCA) – One of the largest ever breaches of healthcare data. The AMCA HIPAA case saw a $21 million financial penalty imposed; however, due to the huge costs incurred as a result of the breach, AMCA filed for bankruptcy protection. Due to the financial position of the company, the financial penalty was suspended and will only need to be paid if AMCA defaults on the terms of the settlement agreement.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 18, 2023\n",
      "The Oklahoma Institute of Allergy Asthma and Immunology was forced to cease trading while it recovered from a cyberattack, with patients forced to wait to receive medical care or seek treatment at other facilities. The asthma and allergy clinic has been closed for at least two weeks as a result of the attack, but the closure appears to be temporary. The clinic furloughed staff while systems were shut down and efforts are being made to restore systems. The closure was necessary as the clinic was unable to access patient records. The clinic has yet to upload a breach notification to its website or report the breach to regulators, so the extent to which patient data has been compromised is not yet known.\n",
      "Larger healthcare providers may temporarily divert ambulances and cancel some appointments following a ransomware attack but do not typically halt operations, but smaller healthcare providers may be left with little alternative. Recently, Murfreesboro Medical Clinic & SurgiCenter in Tennessee halted operations for two weeks while recovering from a cyberattack, and a 2022 survey indicated 25% of healthcare organizations would be forced to temporarily halt operations in the event of a ransomware attack.\n",

Suspicious network activity was detected on November 7, 2022, and its digital environment was immediately secured. Third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to investigate the breach and determined on or around April 7, 2023, that patient data was potentially accessed. The breach notification letter does not state when access to the network was first gained.\n",
      "The review of the affected files confirmed they contained a range of PHI, which varied from individual to individual. That information related to patients who had received healthcare services between March 2012 and November 2022. The information exposed included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, diagnoses/conditions, medications, test results, and procedure information. The notification process was completed on April 10, 2023.\n",
      "Complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services have been offered to affected individuals and security has been improved to prevent similar incidents in the future, including the deployment of the SentinelOne endpoint detection and the response tool, which includes 24/7 monitoring.\n",
      "Asian Health Services Reports Email Account Breach\n",
      "Asian Health Services in Oakland, CA, has recently alerted patients about a recent data security incident involving an employee’s email account. Suspicious activity was detected in the account on February 13, 2023. The account was immediately secured to prevent further unauthorized access and a forensic investigation was conducted to determine the extent of the incident. The email account was determined to have been compromised between February 7, 2023, and February 13, 2023, with the review of emails and attachments confirming they contained names, medical record numbers, dates of birth, phone numbers, and health information such as diagnoses.\n",
      "Asian Health Services did not find any evidence to indicate patient data had been compromised but the possibility could not be ruled out. Affected individuals have been offered complimentary credit monitoring, fraud assistance, and remediation services for 12 months. Asian Health Services said a third-party cybersecurity firm has confirmed that the email account can no longer be accessed, and additional email safeguards have been implemented to provide an additional layer of protection.\n",
      "The incident has yet to appear on the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights breach portal so it is currently unclear how many individuals have been affected.\n",
      "New Mexico Department of Health Reports Impermissible Disclosure of PHI\n",
      "The New Mexico Department of Health has recently confirmed there has been an impermissible disclosure of the protected health information of 49,000 deceased patients to a journalist. The journalist requested information subject to the Inspection of Public Records Act and was sent a spreadsheet that included all deaths in New Mexico from January 2020 to December 2021. It was later discovered that the spreadsheet contained protected health information that should not have been disclosed. The Department of Health said the spreadsheet did not contain names, birthdates, addresses, or contact information.\n",

      "R&B Corporation of Virginia, doing business as Credit Control Corporation (CCC), has recently reported a data breach to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights that has affected 345,523 individuals. CCC is a debt collection agency and business associate of many hospitals and doctor’s offices. The Newport News, VA-based debt collection agency said it detected suspicious activity within its computer systems on March 7, 2023. Its IT systems were immediately isolated, and a forensic investigation was conducted to determine the nature and scope of the activity. On or around March 14, 2023, CCC determined that unauthorized individuals had accessed its systems and copied files that contained sensitive data. The intrusion was determined to have occurred from March 2, 2023, to March 7, 2023.\n",
      "An initial review of the compromised files was completed on May 3, 2023, which confirmed that the files contained information such as names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. Affected individuals were notified by mail on May 15, 2023. Complimentary credit monitoring services have been offered to affected individuals. CCC said it regularly reviews its data security policies, procedures, and practices and will continue to do so, has augmented its security safeguards to better protect patient data, and has increased the frequency of employee training on the importance of safeguarding data.\n",

      "NextGen Healthcare Facing Multiple Class Action Data Breach Lawsuits\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 18, 2023\n",
      "A healthcare data breach of 1 million+ records is certain to result in multiple lawsuits, and the data breach experienced by NextGen Healthcare is no exception. The data breach was only disclosed by NextGen on May 5, but at least a dozen lawsuits have already been filed in federal court in Georgia over the breach.\n",
      "The data breach was the result of a hacking incident involving stolen credentials, which allowed unauthorized individuals to access a database that contained sensitive patient data such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. The investigation determined that the credentials stolen by the hackers came from other sources and did not appear to have been stolen from NextGen. The breach was detected by NextGen on March 30, 2023, and the forensic investigation confirmed hackers had access to its network between March 29, 2023, and April 14, 2023.  This was the second data breach to be reported by NextGen this year, with the earlier incident being a BlackCat ransomware attack. NextGen told the Maine Attorney General that 1,049,375 individuals had been affected and complimentary credit monitoring services have been offered to affected individuals.\n",
      "The lawsuits were all filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, and make similar allegations – That NextGen was negligent for failing to safeguard the sensitive data of patients. The lawsuits claim NextGen was or should have been aware of the high risk of data breaches as multiple warnings have been issued by federal agencies about cybersecurity threats targeting the healthcare sector and extensive media reports about healthcare data breaches. Further, NextGen had suffered a ransomware attack just a few weeks previously and should have known that security needed to be improved.\n",
      "The lawsuits also take issue with the length of time it took to contain the breach – two weeks after the intrusion was detected, the length of time it took to issue notification letters to affected individuals, and the failure to disclose sufficient facts about the data breach in those notification letters to allow the victims to determine the level of risk they face. The lawsuits allege the victims of the breach have already suffered harm and will continue to do so, and face a continuing risk of identity theft and fraud for years to come. The lawsuits seek class action status, a jury trial, damages, legal costs, and injunctive relief, including an order from the court to prohibit NextGen from engaging in unlawful practices and for improvements to be made to its data security practices.\n",

      "FBI and CISA Issue Warning About BianLian Ransomware and Extortion Group\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 18, 2023\n",
      "A joint cybersecurity alert has been issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) about the BianLian ransomware and data extortion group.\n",
      "The BianLian group has been conducting attacks in the United States since at least June 2022 and has actively targeted critical infrastructure organizations, including the healthcare and public health sector. The BianLian group is a ransomware actor that develops and uses ransomware in its attacks, typically engaging in double extortion tactics, where sensitive private data is exfiltrated from victims’ networks before files are encrypted. The group threatens to leak the stolen data if the ransom is not paid. This year, the group has largely switched to extortion-only attacks where files are not encrypted after exfiltration. These attacks have proven to be effective as the release of stolen data can cause significant damage to an organization’s reputation and legal complications.\n",
      "The BianLian group primarily gains access to victims’ networks by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, which may be obtained through brute force attacks to guess weak credentials, purchasing credentials from initial access brokers, or phishing attacks. Once credentials are obtained, the group deploys a custom backdoor specific to each victim, and commercially available remote access tools are downloaded such as TeamViewer, Atera Agent, SplashTop, and AnyDesk. The group uses command-line tools and scripts for network reconnaissance and harvesting more credentials. PowerShell and Windows Command Shell are used to disable antivirus software such as Windows Defender and Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI), and the registry is modified to uninstall services such as Sophos SAVEnabled, SEDenabled, and SAVService services.\n",
      "Tools typically downloaded onto victims’ networks include Advanced Port Scanner, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, SharpShares, and PingCastle to aid discovery, along with native Windows tools and Windows Command Shell, with PsExec and RDP with valid accounts used for lateral movement. Once sensitive data has been located, data exfiltration occurs via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Rclone, or Mega. Once data exfiltration has occurred, threats are issued to publish the stolen data.\n",
      "The best defense against attacks is to limit the use of RDP and other remote desktop services. Audits should be conducted of all remote access tools on the network to identify installed and currently used software. Any remote access tools that are not currently used should be removed or disabled, and RDP should be locked down. Security software should be used to detect instances of remote access software being loaded in the memory, and logs should be reviewed of remote access software to detect any abnormal use.\n",
      "Authorized remote access solutions should only be used from within the network over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual desktop interfaces (VDIs). Inbound and outbound connections on common remote access software ports and protocols should be blocked at the network perimeter. Organizations should also disable command-line services and scripting activities and restrict the use of PowerShell on critical systems, and enhanced PowerShell logging should be enabled. Regular audits of administrative accounts should be conducted, time-based access for accounts should be set at the admin level and higher, and the principle of least privilege should be applied.\n",
      "The cybersecurity alert includes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), details of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the group, and other recommended mitigations.\n",

      "Almost 6 Million Individuals Affected by PharMerica Data Breach\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 17, 2023\n",
      "In late March 2023, the Money Message ransomware group announced it had breached the systems of PharMerica and its parent company, BrightSpring Health Services, and added both to its data leak site. The group claimed to have exfiltrated databases containing 4.7 terabytes of data which included the records of more than 2 million individuals. PharMerica has now confirmed the extent of the data breach.\n",
      "PharMerica is one of the largest providers of pharmacy services in the United States, operating more than 2,500 facilities and over 3,100 pharmacy and healthcare programs. PharMerica and BrightSpring have now completed their investigation and have confirmed that there was unauthorized accessing of sensitive patient information and reported the data breach to the Maine Attorney General and HHS’ Office for Civil Rights as affecting 5,815,591 individuals. That makes it the largest healthcare data breach to be reported by a single HIPAA-covered entity so far in 2023.\n",
      "PharMerica explained in its notification letters that suspicious activity was detected within its computer network on March 14, 2023. The network was isolated, and an investigation was conducted to determine the nature and scope of the intrusion. Assisted by third-party cybersecurity experts, PharMerica determined that “an unknown third party” accessed its computer systems between March 12 and March 13, 2023, and that personal information may have been obtained from its systems during that time frame.\n",
      "By March 21, 2023, PharMerica had determined that the compromised information included names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, medication information, and health insurance information. PharMerica made no mention of a ransomware attack nor any publication of data online but did state that “we have no reason to believe that anyone’s information has been misused for the purpose of committing fraud or identity theft.”\n",
      "Affected individuals have been notified and offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months. Patients and executors of deceased patients’ estates have been advised to contact any one of the three national credit reporting agencies and to ensure the individual’s credit file is marked as ‘deceased – do not issue credit’, or for the credit reporting agency to make a notation on the individual’s credit file to notify an individual (such as a family member/next of kin) and/or law enforcement if an application is made for credit. PharMerica says it has implemented additional technical cybersecurity safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n",

      "EyeMed Vision Care Settles Multistate Data Breach Investigation for $2.5 Million\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 17, 2023\n",
      "In June 2020, the Luxottica Group PIVA-owned vision insurance company, EyeMed Vision Care, experienced a data breach involving the protected health information (PHI) of 2.1 million patients. An unauthorized individual gained access to an employee email account that contained approximately 6 years of personal and medical information including names, contact information, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, vision insurance account/identification numbers, medical diagnoses and conditions, and treatment information. The unauthorized third party then used the email account to distribute around 2,000 phishing emails.\n",
      "State attorneys general have the authority to investigate data breaches and can fine organizations for HIPAA violations. A multi-state investigation was launched by state attorneys general in Oregon, New Jersey, and Florida into the EyeMed data breach, and Pennsylvania later joined the multistate action. The state attorneys general sought to establish whether the data breach was preventable and if it was the result of a failure to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule and state data protection laws.\n",
      "The investigation identified data security failures that violated HIPAA and state laws. Under HIPAA and state data protection laws, entities that collect, maintain, or handle sensitive personal and medical information are required to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information, yet those safeguards were found to be lacking at EyeMed. The investigation revealed a failure to ensure all individuals with access to protected health information had a unique login and password. Several EyeMed employees were found to be sharing a single password for an email account that was used to communicate sensitive information, including PHI related to vision benefits enrollment and coverage.\n",
      "Under the terms of the settlement, EyeMed agreed to pay a financial penalty of $2.5 million which will be shared between Oregon, New Jersey, Florida, and Pennsylvania. The settlement also requires EyeMed to ensure compliance with state consumer protection acts, state personal information protection acts, and HIPAA law, and ensure EyeMed does not misrepresent the extent to which it maintains and protects the privacy, security, or confidentiality of consumer information.\n",
      "The data security requirements of the settlement include the development, implementation, and maintenance of a written information security program; maintenance of reasonable policies and procedures governing the collection, use, and retention of patient information; and maintenance of appropriate controls to manage access to all accounts that receive and transmit sensitive information. ”New Jerseyans trusted EyeMed with their vision care and their personal information only to have that trust broken by the company’s poor security measures,” said Attorney General Platkin, who co-led the investigation. “This is more than just a monetary settlement, it’s about changing companies’ behavior to better protect crucial patient data.”\n",
      "The Office of the New York Attorney General also investigated EyeMed over the data breach and entered into a separate settlement agreement last year, which required EyeMed to pay a $600,000 penalty. In October 2022, a $4.5 million settlement was agreed between EyeMed and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to resolve alleged violations of the NYDFS (Part 500) cybersecurity regulations. The security failures included not limiting employee access privileges to email accounts for 9 employees, a partial rollout of multifactor authentication, risk assessment failures, the lack of a sufficient data minimization strategy, and inaccurate submissions of compliance with Part 500 for four years. The settlements with NYDFS and the New York Attorney General also had data security requirements, including the implementation and maintenance of a comprehensive information security program, encryption of data, multi-factor authentication for all administrative and remote access accounts, and penetration testing.\n",
      "HIPAA compliance investigations by state attorneys general are independent of the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which may also choose to impose civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. No penalty has been announced by OCR as of May 2023 and the incident is marked as closed on the OCR breach portal.\n",

      "OCR Fines Arkansas Business Associate $350,000 for Impermissibly Disclosing ePHI\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 16, 2023\n",
      "The HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has agreed to settle a HIPAA investigation of an Arkansas business associate that impermissibly disclosed the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of more than 230,000 individuals after failing to secure a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. MedEvolve, Inc. is a Little Rock, AR-based HIPAA business associate that provides practice management, revenue cycle management, and practice analytics software to HIPAA-regulated entities. The nature of MedEvolve’s business means it has access to ePHI from its HIPAA-regulated entity clients. Under HIPAA, MedEvolve is required to ensure that information is safeguarded at all times.\n",
      "In July 2018, MedEvolve informed OCR that an error had been made configuring an FTP server. MedEvolve’s investigation revealed the server contained the ePHI of 230,572 individuals, which could be freely accessed over the Internet without authentication. The breach affected two HIPAA-regulated entities: Premier Immediate Medical Care, LLC (204,607 individuals) and Dr. Beverly Held (25,965 individuals). The exposed information included names, billing addresses, telephone numbers, health insurer information, doctor’s office account numbers, and, for some individuals, Social Security numbers.\n",
      "OCR launched an investigation and identified three potential violations of the HIPAA Rules: An impermissible disclosure of the ePHI of 230,572 individuals – 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a); a failure to enter into a business associate agreement with a subcontractor – 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(e)(1)(ii); and an insufficiently thorough and accurate assessment of potential risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI – 45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A).\n",
      "MedEvolve chose to settle the case with no admission of liability or wrongdoing and paid a financial penalty of $350,000. The settlement also includes a corrective action plan that requires MEdEvolve to conduct accurate and thorough risk assessments, implement risk management plans to address identified risks, develop, implement, and maintain policies and procedures to comply with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, and improve its workforce HIPAA and security training program.\n",
      "“Ensuring that security measures are in place to protect electronic protected health information where it is stored is an integral part of cybersecurity and the protection of patient privacy,” said OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer. “HIPAA-regulated entities must ensure that they are not leaving patient health information unsecured on network servers available to the public via the Internet.”\n",
      "This is the fourth HIPAA penalty to be imposed by OCR this year and follows a $15,000 settlement with  David Mente, MA, LPC, and a $16,500 settlement with Life Hope Labs, LLC, to resolve HIPAA Right of Access violations, and a $1,250,000 settlement with Banner Health to resolve multiple HIPAA Security Rule violations.\n",

      "The settlements pursued by OCR are for egregious violations of HIPAA Rules. Settlements are also pursued to highlight common HIPAA violations to raise awareness of the need to comply with specific aspects of HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "The settlement amounts reflect the seriousness of the violation, the length of time the violation has been allowed to persist, the number of violations identified, and the financial position of the covered entity/business associate.\n",
      "1. Snooping on Healthcare Records\n",
      "Accessing the health records of patients for reasons other than those permitted by the Privacy Rule is a violation of patient privacy. Snooping on healthcare records of family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and celebrities is one of the most common HIPAA violations committed by employees. When discovered, these violations can result in termination of employment but could also result in criminal charges for the employee concerned. Financial penalties for healthcare organizations that have failed to prevent snooping are relatively uncommon, but they are possible – as the University of California Los Angeles Health System discovered.\n",
      "University of California Los Angeles Health System was fined $865,000 for failing to restrict access to medical records. The healthcare provider was investigated following the discovery that a physician had accessed the medical records of celebrities and other patients without authorization. Dr. Huping Zhou accessed the records of patients without authorization 323 times after learning that he would soon be dismissed.  Dr. Zhou became the first healthcare employee to be jailed for a HIPAA violation and was sentenced to four months in federal prison.\n",
      "2. Failure to Perform an Organization-Wide Risk Analysis\n",
      "The failure to perform an organization-wide risk analysis is one of the most common HIPAA violations to result in a financial penalty. If the risk analysis is not performed regularly, organizations will not be able to determine whether any vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI exist. Risks are therefore likely to remain unaddressed, leaving the door wide open for violations to occur.\n",
      "HIPAA settlements with covered entities for the failure to conduct an organization-wide risk assessment include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Premera Blue Cross– $6,850,000 settlement for risk analysis and risk management failures, and other potential HIPAA violations\n",
      "Excellus Health Plan – $5,100,000 settlement for risk analysis and risk management failures, and other potential HIPAA violations\n",
      "Oregon Health & Science University– $2.7 million settlement for the lack of an enterprise-wide risk analysis.\n",
      "Cardionet – $2.5 million settlement for an incomplete risk analysis and lack of risk management processes.\n",
      "Cancer Care Group – $750,000 settlement for the failure to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis.\n",
      "Lahey Hospital and Medical Center – $850,000 settlement for the failure to conduct an organization-wide risk assessment and other HIPAA violations.\n",
      "Steven A. Porter, M.D – $100,000 penalty for risk analysis and risk management failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Failure to Manage Security Risks / Lack of a Risk Management Process\n",
      "Performing a risk analysis is essential, but it is not just a checkbox item for compliance. Risks that are identified must then be subjected to a risk management process. They should be prioritized and addressed in a reasonable time frame. Knowing about risks to PHI and failing to address them one of the most common HIPAA violations penalized by the Office for Civil Rights.\n",
      "HIPAA settlements with covered entities for the failure to manage identified risks include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Alaska Department of Health and Social Services – $1.7 million penalty for the failure to perform risk analysis and risk management failures.\n",
      "University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) – $650,000 penalty for risk management failures.\n",
      "Metro Community Provider Network – $400,000 penalty for risk management failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Denying Patients Access to Health Records/Exceeding Timescale for Providing Access\n",
      "The HIPAA Privacy Rule gives patients the right to access their medical records and obtain copies on request. This allows patients to check their records for errors and share them with other entities and individuals. Denying patients access to health records, overcharging for copies, or failing to provide records within 30 days is a violation of HIPAA. OCR made HIPAA Right of Access violations one of its key enforcement objectives in late 2019.\n",
      "HIPAA settlements with covered entities for denying patients access to their records or unnecessary delays in providing access include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Expressions Dental Center of Georgia, P.C. – $80,000 penalty for excessive charges for a copy of PHI and delay in providing records.\n",
      "Cignet Health of Prince George’s County – $4,300,000 penalty for denying patients access to their medical records.\n",

      "OCR Announces 11 Enforcement Actions – One CMP and 10 settlements were announced by OCR in July 2021 to resolve Right of Access violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Failure to Enter into a HIPAA-Compliant Business Associate Agreement\n",
      "The failure to enter into a HIPAA-compliant business associate agreement with all vendors that are provided with or given access to PHI is another of the most common HIPAA violations. Even when business associate agreements are held for all vendors, they may not be HIPAA compliant, especially if they have not been revised after the Omnibus Final Rule.\n",
      "Notable settlements for these common HIPAA violations include:\n",
      "\n",

      "6. Insufficient ePHI Access Controls\n",
      "The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and their business associates to limit access to ePHI to authorized individuals. The failure to implement appropriate ePHI access controls is also one of the most common HIPAA violations and one that has attracted several financial penalties.\n",
      "Financial penalties issued to covered entities for ePHI access control failures include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Anthem Inc. – $16,000,000 penalty for access control failures and other serious HIPAA violations.\n",
      "Memorial Healthcare System – $5,500,000 penalty for insufficient ePHI access controls.\n",
      "Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services – $1,600,000 penalty for risk analysis failures, access control failures, and information system monitoring failures.\n",
      "University of California Los Angeles Health System – $865,500 penalty for the failure to restrict access to medical records.\n",
      "Pagosa Springs Medical Center – $111,400 penalty for the failure to terminate access to ePHI after an employee termination and a lack of a business associate agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Failure to Use Encryption or an Equivalent Measure to Safeguard ePHI on Portable Devices\n",
      "One of the most effective methods of preventing data breaches is to encrypt PHI. Breaches of encrypted PHI are not reportable security incidents unless the key to decrypt data is also accessed. Encryption is not mandatory under HIPAA Rules, but it cannot be ignored. If the decision is taken not to use encryption, an alternative, equivalent security measure must be used in its place.\n",
      "Recent settlements for the failure to safeguard PHI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Children’s Medical Center of Dallas – $3.2 million civil monetary penalty for failing to take action to address known risks, including the failure to use encryption on portable devices.\n",
      "Catholic Health Care Services of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia– $650,000 settlement for the failure to use encryption, the failure to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis, and to manage risks.\n",
      "Lifespan Health System Affiliated Covered Entity – $1,040,000 penalty for the failure to encrypt data and implement appropriate device and media controls, resulting in the impermissible disclosure of 20,431 patients’ ePHI\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Exceeding the 60-Day Deadline for Issuing Breach Notifications\n",
      "The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities to issue notifications of breaches without unnecessary delay, and certainly no later than 60 days following the discovery of a data breach. Exceeding that time frame is one of the most common HIPAA violations, which has seen several recent penalties issued:\n",
      "\n",
      "Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences – $875,000 settlement for delayed breach notifications to individuals and the HHS, and to resolve 5 other HIPAA violations.\n",
      "Presence Health – $475,000 settlement for delaying the issuing of breach notifications by a month.\n",
      "CoPilot Provider Support Services Inc. – $130,000 settlement with NY Attorney General for delayed breach notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Impermissible Disclosures of Protected Health Information\n",
      "Any disclosure of protected health information that is not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule can attract a financial penalty. This violation category includes disclosing PHI to a patient’s employer for a purpose not permitted by the Privacy Rule, potential disclosures following the theft or loss of unencrypted laptop computers, careless handling of PHI, disclosing PHI unnecessarily, not adhering to the ‘minimum necessary’ standard, and disclosures of PHI after patient authorizations have expired.\n",
      "Settlements for impermissible disclosures of PHI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. U. Phillip Igbinadolor, D.M.D. & Associates, P.A. – $50,000 civil monetary penalty for impermissible disclosures of PHI on social media websites\n",

      "Brigham and Women’s Hospital– $384,000 penalty for filming patients without consent.\n",
      "Boston Medical Center – $100,000 penalty for filming patients without consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Improper Disposal of PHI\n",
      "When physical PHI and ePHI are no longer required and retention periods have expired, HIPAA Rules require the information to be securely and permanently destroyed. For paper records this could involve shredding or pulping and for ePHI, degaussing, securely wiping, or destroying the electronic devices on which the ePHI is stored to prevent impermissible disclosures.\n",
      "Financial penalties issued to covered entities for improper disposal of PHI/ePHI include:\n",
      "\n",
      "New England Dermatology and Laser Center – $300,640 penalty for disposing of empty specimen containers with regular trash, exposing the PHI of 58,106 individuals over 10 years.\n",
      "Parkview Health – $800,000 penalty for the failure to securely dispose of paper records containing PHI.\n",

      "Non-Financial HIPAA Violation Examples\n",
      "HIPAA violations do not always result in financial penalties. Many violations of HIPAA investigated by OCR are resolved by guidance, technical assistance, and/or a corrective action plan depending on the nature of the violation and the harm caused, the covered entity’s previous history of violations, and their willingness to cooperate with an OCR investigation.\n",
      "Because violations resolved by guidance, technical assistance, and/or a corrective action plan rarely attract headlines, some of the work done by OCR to promote compliance with HIPAA can be overlooked. However, as of March 2022, OCR has investigated and resolved 29,478 cases without issuing a financial penalty. Non-financial HIPAA violation examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "A hospital was required to implement new minimum necessary policies for telephone messages after an employee left a telephone message with the daughter of a patient that detailed both her medical condition and treatment plan.\n",
      "A mental health center was required to correct its process for providing Notices of Privacy Practices prior to an intake assessment after the center failed to provide the father of a minor patient with an NPP prior to a mental health evaluation.\n",
      "A covered entity was required to withdraw a $100 “records review fee” charged to a patient for providing the patient with copies of his medical records. Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities are only allowed to charge a reasonable cost-based fee.\n",
      "A private practice was required to implement policies on the verbal communication of PHI after a staff member discussed HIV testing procedures with a patient in the practice´s waiting room – thereby disclosing PHI to others in the waiting room.\n",
      "A radiology practice was required to revise its processes for workers´ compensation disclosures after a patient´s imaging tests were sent to the patient´s employer to support a claim for which the employer´s program was not responsible for payment.\n",
      "A health plan was required to correct a flaw in its computer system, review transactions for a six-month period, and correct corrupted patient information after PHI was included in an explanation of benefits letter mailed to an unauthorized family member.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of HIPAA Violations by Healthcare Employees\n",
      "Snooping on healthcare records is a fairly obvious HIPAA violation and one that all healthcare employees who have received HIPAA training should know is a violation of their employer’s policies and HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "Other examples of HIPAA violations often come about as a result of misunderstandings about HIPAA requirements. While each of these common HIPAA violations affect far fewer numbers of patients than the above violations, they can still cause a significant amount of harm to the patient(s) involved and their employer. They can also result in disciplinary action against the employee responsible – including termination.\n",
      "Listed below are some of the common HIPAA violations committed by healthcare employees. These common HIPAA violations should be covered as part of the HIPAA training given to employees to raise awareness to these frequent areas of noncompliance.\n",
      "Emailing ePHI to Personal Email Accounts and Removing PHI from a Healthcare Facility\n",
      "It can be difficult to find the time to complete all the necessary tasks within working hours and it can be tempting to take work home to complete. Removing protected health information from a healthcare facility places that information at risk of exposure. This is a common employee HIPAA violation and may even be routine practice at a healthcare facility that is understaffed. That does not mean it is an acceptable practice.\n",
      "The same applies to emailing ePHI to personal email accounts. Regardless of the intentions, whether it is to get help with spreadsheets, complete work at home to get ahead for the next day, or to catch up on a backlog, it is a violation of HIPAA Rules.  Further, any emailing of ePHI to a personal email account could be considered theft – the repercussions of which could be far more severe than termination of an employment contract.\n",
      "Leaving Portable Electronic Devices and Paperwork Unattended\n",
      "The HIPAA Security Rule requires PHI and ePHI to be secured at all times. If paperwork is left unattended it could be viewed by an unauthorized individual, be that a member of staff, patient, or visitor to the healthcare facility. Were that to happen it would be considered an impermissible disclosure of PHI.\n",
      "Electronic devices that contain ePHI must similarly be secured at all times. Electronic devices are portable and valuable. Opportunistic thieves could easily steal an unattended device and gain access to ePHI. There have been many cases of healthcare employees removing unencrypted devices from healthcare facilities, only for them to be stolen from vehicles or homes. Theft can also easily occur within a healthcare facility if devices are not secured. Healthcare employees must ensure that their employer’s policies are followed, and HIPAA Rules are not violated by leaving devices and paperwork unattended.\n",
      "Releasing Patient Information to an Unauthorized Individual\n",
      "An authorization form must be obtained from a patient before any of their PHI can be disclosed to a third party for a purpose other than one expressly permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Disclosing PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment for healthcare, or healthcare operations (and limited other cases) is a HIPAA violation if authorization has not been received from the patient in advance.\n",
      "Healthcare employees must ensure that, prior to disclosing PHI to a third party, authorization has been obtained from the patient and information is not disclosed to any individual or company  not included on the authorization form. Authorization forms are only valid if they have been signed by the patient or their nominated representative.\n",
      "Releasing Patient Information Without Authorization\n",
      "In a similar vein to the previous point, healthcare employees must also exercise caution about the types of information that are released to third parties, even if an authorization form has been received allowing a specific individual, company, or organization to receive PHI.\n",
      "The authorization form should include what types of information have been authorized to be released. Any information not detailed on the authorization form must remain private and confidential and should not be shared. The disclosure of additional information would violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n",
      "Disclosures of PHI to Third Parties After the Expiry of an Authorization\n",
      "All HIPAA authorization forms must include the names or classes of individuals who are being authorized to receive PHI, the types of PHI that will be disclosed, and the reasons for the disclosures. They must also include an expiry date for the authorization.\n",
      "PHI must not be disclosed to any individual listed on the authorization form after the expiry date has passed, even if authorization has previously been given to that entity to receive PHI. A new authorization form is required before any further disclosure takes place. It should also be noted that an authorization form without an expiry date is not HIPAA compliant.\n",
      "Impermissible Disclosures of Patient Health Records\n",
      "The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits patients to obtain a copy of their health records on request or have their records provided to a nominated third party such as a personal representative or other individual. If not collected in person by the patient, the third party must have been given authorization by the patient – on a HIPAA authorization form – to receive the records before they can be released.\n",
      "Prior to providing copies of patient health records, healthcare employees must verify the identity of the patient or the person collecting the records and must ensure records are only released to an individual authorized to receive them. Care must also be taken to ensure that the correct patient’s records are released.\n",
      "Downloading PHI onto Unauthorized Devices\n",
      "It can be difficult for healthcare IT departments to keep track of all devices that connect to the network, given how many different devices have network access. Ensuring those devices are secured can be an even bigger problem, yet this is a requirement for HIPAA compliance.\n",
      "Employees need to be aware that there are privacy and security risks associated with downloading ePHI to unauthorized portable electronic devices. Not only does this increase the risk of an accidental disclosure of ePHI – in the event that the device is lost or stolen – it could also be viewed as theft and a HIPAA violation.\n",
      "Providing Unauthorized Access to Medical Records\n",
      "It is the responsibility of the covered entity to ensure that access to patient health information and medical records is only given to authorized individuals. This is achieved by implementing access controls via unique logins.\n",
      "Employees have a responsibility to ensure that they do not give access to health information to co-workers who many not have the same access rights. The sharing of login credentials could not only result in an impermissible disclosure of ePHI, any actions taken by that employee would be attributed to the individual whose login credentials were used to gain access.\n",

      "Actual Examples of HIPAA Violations by Employees\n",
      "There are not very many examples of HIPAA violations by employees because most are dealt with internally according to the organization´s sanction policy. However, in a few cases, employees´ contracts are terminated and examples of HIPAA violations by employees are brought to the attention of the outside world. The following is a small selection of those we have reported on:\n",
      "In May 2013, Dianna Hereford was terminated from her position of staff nurse at the Norton Audubon Hospital for improperly disclosing the condition of a patient with Hepatitis C. Hereford claimed she was wrongfully dismissed for an incidental disclosure; but her claim was dismissed by Jefferson Circuit Court and by Kentucky´s Court of Appeals when she appealed the decision.\n",
      "In March 2017, an employee of New Jersey-based BioReference Laboratories was terminated from their position for failing to securely dispose of documents containing the PHI of 1,772 patients. Rather than following the company´s policy for disposing of PHI, which involved shredding the documents before disposing of them, the employee threw the documents into a dumpster.\n",
      "Also in 2017, an employee of Lowell General Hospital in Massachusetts was fired for snooping on the healthcare records of 769 patients. As mentioned above, snooping on healthcare records is one of the most common HIPAA violations; but whereas it normally impacts patients who are known to the employee, this was an extreme example of a HIPAA violation by an employee.\n",
      "Are Data Breaches HIPAA Violations?\n",
      "Data breaches are now a fact of life. Even with multi-layered cybersecurity defenses, data breaches are still likely to occur from time to time. OCR understands that healthcare organizations are being targeted by cybercriminals and that it is not possible to implement impregnable security defenses.\n",
      "Being HIPAA compliant is not about making sure that data breaches never happen. HIPAA compliance is about reducing risk to an appropriate and acceptable level. Just because an organization experiences a data breach, it does not mean the breach was the result of a HIPAA violation.\n",
      "The OCR breach portal now reflects this more clearly. Many data breaches are investigated by OCR and are found not to involve any violations of HIPAA Rules. Consequently, the investigations are closed without any action being taken.\n",
      "How are HIPAA Violations Discovered?\n",
      "HIPAA violations can continue for many months, or even years, before they are discovered. The longer they are allowed to persist, the greater the penalty will be when they are eventually discovered. It is therefore important for HIPAA-covered entities to conduct regular HIPAA compliance reviews (this is required by the HIPAA law) to make sure HIPAA violations are discovered and corrected before they are identified by regulators.\n",
      "There are three main ways that HIPAA violations are discovered:\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigations into a data breach by OCR (or state attorneys general)\n",
      "Investigations into complaints about covered entities and business associates\n",
      "HIPAA compliance audits\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when a data breach does not involve a HIPAA violation, or a complaint proves to be unfounded, OCR may uncover unrelated HIPAA violations that could warrant a financial penalty.\n",

      "FAQs\n",
      "What does it mean to “reduce risk to an appropriate and acceptable level”?\n",
      "What reducing risk to an appropriate and acceptable level means is that, when potential risks and vulnerabilities are identified, Covered Entities and Business Associates have to decide what measures are reasonable to implement according to the size, complexity, and capabilities of the organization, the existing measures already in place, and the cost of implementing further measures in relation to the likelihood of a data breach and the scale of injury it could cause.\n",
      "How is it possible to prevent employees snooping on healthcare records?\n",
      "To prevent employees snooping on healthcare records, Covered Entities should implement a program of training, ensure access privileges comply with the Minimum Necessary Standard, activate audit logs, and enforce sanctions. It is also important that employees are made aware during HIPAA training that, although many cases of healthcare snooping are attributable to curiosity rather than malicious intent, all cases of healthcare snooping are HIPAA violations.\n",
      "If encryption is not mandatory, how can it be a HIPAA violation if records are unencrypted?\n",
      "Although encryption is not mandatory, it can be a HIPAA violation if records are unencrypted and no other measure that is equally as effective has been implemented. Encryption is an addressable implementation specification of the Security Rule. This means organizations can only avoid implementing the requirement if it is not reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, or if an alternative security measure is equally as effective. If organizations fail to encrypt records, they have to document the reasons why.\n",
      "Why was the fine for denying patients access to health records so high?\n",
      "The fine for denying patients access to health records was so high in the event mentioned in the article because, in this particular case, the non-cooperation of the Covered Entity contributed to the size of the fine (you can read about the case here). Since this case, the CMS´ Meaningful Use program has evolved into the Promoting Interoperability program, and – in addition to being sanctioned for a HIPAA violation – any covered entity failing to provide health records in a timely manner could now also lose a percentage of their Medicare payments.\n",
      "What are the consequences of accessing a patient chart without reason?\n",
      "The consequences of accessing a patient chart without reason vary depending on the reason for the impermissible access and the organization´s sanctions policy. If it was an employee’s first violation and no harm was caused by the violation, it is likely the employee will receive a warning and have to undergo additional training. If the violation was a repeat offence, caused harm to the patient or organization, and was done with malicious intent, the likely consequences are termination of contract, a report to a licensing authority, and the possible involvement of law enforcement.\n",
      "Are HIPAA violations common?\n",
      "Nobody knows if HIPAA violations are common because, although HHS´ Office for Civil Rights publishes an “Enforcement Highlights” webpage, the statistics on this page only relate to reports and complaints received by the agency. HIPAA violations can also be reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), State Attorneys General, the Covered Entity at which the HIPAA violation occurred, or not reported at all.\n",
      "How do HIPAA violations affect patients?\n",
      "HIPAA violations affect patients in different ways depending on the nature of the violation. If a hospital has failed to enter into a Business Associate Agreement with a company that provides data analysis services, the violation will not affect patients at all. Conversely, if a HIPAA violation results in the exposure of patients’ personal information, which is then used to conduct identity theft, this will significantly affect patients. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.\n",
      "What are examples of HIPAA violations?\n",
      "In addition to the examples of HIPAA violations listed above, Covered Entities can violate HIPAA by failing to comply with the Administrative Requirements of HIPAA. These include the Transaction, Code Sets, and Identifier Standards published by the Department of Health and Human Services; and although Covered Entities are not fined for violations of this nature, they can be excluded from the Medicare program by CMS – which will substantially affect their income.\n",
      "What is considered a HIPAA violation by the Federal Trade Commission?\n",
      "An event considered a HIPAA violation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a failure to comply with the Breach Notification Rule by an organization that has access to PHI, but which does not qualify as a Covered Entity or Business Associate – for example, vendors of Personal Health Records.\n",
      "Organizations that are not Covered Entities or Business Associates do not have to comply with the Privacy or Security Rule, but they do have to comply with the Breach Notification Rule; and the failure to notify individuals and the FTC of a data breach is considered a HIPAA violation by the FTC – which has the authority to issue substantial fines for non-compliance.\n",
      "What counts as a HIPAA violation by employees?\n",
      "What counts as a HIPAA violation by employees is the failure to comply with employers’ HIPAA-related policies and procedures – provided employees have received adequate training on the policies and procedures. In such cases, the employee will be subject to the sanctions listed in their employer’s sanctions policy (verbal warning, written warning, suspension, termination, etc.).\n",
      "Employees can also violate HIPAA by knowingly and wrongfully disclosing PHI. In such cases, employers are required to notify HHS´ Office for Civil Rights, who will refer the case to the Department of Justice. If there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the Department of Justice can pursue fines of up to $250,000 for HIPAA violations by employees and custodial sentences of up to ten years.\n",
      "What constitutes a HIPAA violation by Business Associates?\n",
      "What constitutes a HIPAA violation by Business Associates is the failure to comply with any parts of the Security Rule, the requirement to notify Covered Entities of any security incident (not only breaches of unsecured ePHI), or any other requirement stipulated in a Business Associate Agreement.\n",
      "Generally, Business Associates are required to comply with all the Security Rule and several sections of the Breach Notification Rule. Additionally, depending on the service they provide for or on behalf of a Covered Entity – and the content of Business Associate Agreements – Business Associates may also be required to comply with parts of the Administrative Requirements and the Privacy Rule.\n",
      "What are the 3 types of HIPAA violations?\n",
      "There are many “3 types of HIPAA violations”. For example, there are criminal, civil, and accidental violations of HIPAA; Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule violations of HIPAA; and violations of HIPAA reportable to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), HHS´ Office for Civil Rights, and the Federal Trade Commission.\n",
      "Is it possible for there to be an intentional but acceptable HIPAA violation?\n",
      "It is possible for there to be an intentional but acceptable HIPAA violation, but only when HHS’ Office for Civil Rights issues a Notice of Enforcement Discretion. These Notices allow Covered Entities to intentionally violate certain HIPAA provisions in certain circumstances for the period of time a Notice of Enforcement Discretion is in force.\n",
      "It is important to be aware that disclosing PHI in an emergency situation to a Covered Entity with whom no treatment relationship exists is not an intentional but acceptable HIPAA violation. This scenario is permitted by §164.510 of the Privacy Rule provided that any PHI disclosed is limited and relevant to an individual´s care.\n",
      "Who is responsible for most common HIPAA violations?\n",
      "It is not known who is responsible for most common HIPAA violations because it is highly likely most common HIPAA violations are reported to the organization where the violation occurred and this information is not released into the public domain. Additionally, Business Associates are required to report “security incidents” to Covered Entities who then notify affected individuals and HHS’ Office for Civil Rights if the security incident constitutes a breach of unsecured PHI.\n",
      "Why are there no examples of HIPAA violations by employers?\n",
      "There are no examples of HIPAA violations by employers because employers are not Covered Entities under HIPAA. Even if a healthcare organization qualifies as a Covered Entity, it is not required to comply with HIPAA in its role as an employer – just in its role as a healthcare organization.\n",
      "An exception to this explanation exists if an employer administers a self-sponsored health plan. However, because this is a rare scenario – and because employers in this situation are only subject to partial compliance – there are no examples of HIPAA violations by employers publicly reported.\n",
      "What are the consequences of accessing a patient chart without reason?\n",
      "The consequences of accessing a patient chart without reason depend on multiple factors. If the person who accessed the chart was a member of a Covered Entity’s workforce, if they did not have authorization to access the chart, and if they had received training on the Covered Entity’s policies, the event is a violation of the Covered Entity’s policies.\n",
      "Therefore, the consequences of accessing a patient chart without reason depend on the content of the Covered Entity’s sanctions policy. This may mean the person is given a verbal warning and required to undergo refresher training; or, if the person has received previous verbal warnings, the consequences could be a written warning, final warning, or termination of contract.\n",
      "What are HIPAA violations?\n",
      "HIPAA violations are the failure to comply with the provisions and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions (45 CFR Parts 160,162, and 164). Most HIPAA violations are civil incidents committed by Covered Entities and Business Associates. It is rare that an individual violates HIPAA because individuals are most often members of a Covered Entity’s or Business Associate’s workforce and subject to their employer’s policies.\n",
      "Are all violations of HIPAA resolved by financial penalties?\n",
      "Very few violations of HIPAA are resolved by financial penalties. In most cases, violations of HIPAA are resolved by voluntary compliance, technical assistance, or corrective action plans. However, these “secondary” resolutions also have a financial cost in terms of revising policies and procedures, implementing safeguards, retraining members of the workforce, and other business disruptions.\n",

      "Are lost medical records a HIPAA violation?\n",
      "Lost medical records are a HIPAA violation – even if the records are subsequently found – because there has been a failure to ensure the availability of PHI when the records were lost. Additionally, while the medical records were lost, they may have been viewed or altered by an unauthorized person, so there has also been a failure to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of PHI.\n",
      "What is considered a HIPAA violation punishable by a custodial sentence?\n",
      "A HIPAA violation punishable by a custodial sentence is considered to be when a person knowingly and wrongfully obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information without authorization. Depending on the motive and whether the act was committed under false pretenses, the person can be fined up to $250,000 and given a custodial sentence of up to ten years.\n",
      "Who can violate HIPAA?\n",
      "Who can violate HIPAA is limited to Covered Entities, Business Associates, and members of their workforces. If an organization is not a Covered Entity or Business Associate, or an individual is not a member of either’s workforce, it is not possible to violate HIPAA because HIPAA will not apply to the organization/individual.\n",
      "What is a HIPAA violation of the Breach Notification Rule?\n",
      "A HIPAA violation of the Breach Notification Rule is the failure to comply with any provision of 45 CFR 164 Subpart D when Protected Health Information has been acquired, accessed, used, or disclosed in a manner not permitted by the Privacy Rule, and the impermissible acquisition, access, use, or disclosure compromises the security or privacy of the Protected Health Information.\n",
      "Is it a HIPAA violation to say someone is in the hospital?\n",
      "It can be a HIPAA violation to say someone is in the hospital, but only in a limited number of circumstances. For example, the person making the statement must be a member of a Covered Entity’s workforce, the statement must be made to somebody with whom there is no direct treatment or familial relationship, and when the subject of the statement has not been given an opportunity to object to the statement being made.\n",
      "Is inappropriate access to medical records a HIPAA violation example or a HIPAA breach example?\n",
      "Inappropriate access to medical records is certainly a HIPAA violation example regardless of who the individual accessing the medical records is. Whether or not it constitutes a HIPAA breach example depends on whether the inappropriate access compromises the security or privacy of the Protected Health Information maintained in the medical records.\n",
      "Is there a list of HIPAA violations?\n",
      "There is no list of HIPAA violations because many HIPAA violations are reported to the organization at which they occurred, and they never become public knowledge. What you can find a list of is a list of HIPAA data breaches affecting more than 500 individuals that have been reported to HHS’ Office for Civil Rights. This list can be found on the HHS’ Breach Report web page.\n",
      "Can you sue someone for disclosing medical information?\n",
      "You cannot sue someone for disclosing medical information under HIPAA because HIPAA has no private right of action. However, if you believe someone has disclosed your medical information – and because of the disclosure you have suffered harm – you may be able to file a civil action under a state law. Because some states have privacy and security laws that include a private right or action and others don´t, it is best to seek legal advice from a local attorney.\n",
      "How can I find out who has accessed my medical records?\n",
      "You can find out who has accessed your medical records by requesting an Accounting of Disclosures from your healthcare provider. The healthcare provider has to reply to your request within 30 days and provide you with a list of every time you’re your medical records have been accessed for uses other than those permitted by the Privacy Rule (i.e., treatments, payments, etc.).\n",
      "Who can access my medical records without my permission?\n",
      "Your medical records can be accessed without your permission by any member of a Covered Entity’s or Business Associate’s workforce provided they have the authority to access your records and the reason why they are accessing your medical records is permitted by the Privacy Rule. If your medical records are accessed by somebody without the authority to do so, or for a reason not permitted by the Privacy Rule, this would be a violation of HIPAA.\n",
      "Can a family member violate HIPAA?\n",
      "A family member can violate HIPAA if, for example, they are also your dentist and they disclose your health information impermissibly. However, if the family member is not a member of the medical profession – or a member of a Covered Entity´s or Business Associate’s workforce – it is not possible for them to violate HIPAA because only Covered Entities, Business Associates, and members of their workforces are required to comply with HIPAA\n",

      "What is Considered PHI Under HIPAA?\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 16, 2023\n",
      "In a healthcare environment, you are likely to hear health information referred to as protected health information or PHI, but what is considered PHI under HIPAA? PHI is defined as different things by different sources. Some define PHI as patient health data (it isn´t), as the 18 HIPAA identifiers (it´s not those either), or as a phrase coined by the HIPAA Act of 1996 to describe identifiable information in medical records (close – except the term Protected Health Information was not used in relation to HIPAA until 1999).\n",
      "What is Really Considered PHI Under HIPAA Rules?\n",
      "To best explain what is really considered PHI under HIPAA compliance rules, it is necessary to review the definitions section of the Administrative Simplification Regulations (§160.103) starting with health information. According to this section, health information means any information, including genetic information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium, that:\n",
      "“Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health care clearinghouse; and relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual.”\n",
      "From here, we need to progress to the definition of individually identifiable health information which states “individually identifiable health information […] is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual [that] is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse […] and that identifies the individual or […] can be used to identify the individual.”\n",
      "Finally, we move onto the definition of protected health information, which states “protected health information means individually identifiable health information transmitted by electronic media, maintained in electronic media, or transmitted or maintained in any other form or medium”.\n",
      "More about what is Considered PHI under HIPAA\n",
      "To simplify a definition of what is considered PHI under HIPAA: health information is any information relating a patient´s condition, the past, present, or future provision of healthcare, or payment thereof. It becomes individually identifiable health information when identifiers are included in the same record set, and it becomes protected when it is transmitted or maintained in any form (by a covered entity).\n",
      "Generally, HIPAA covered entities are limited to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct electronic transactions for which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published standards. The standards can be found in Subparts I to S of the HIPAA Administrative Data Standards. Therefore:\n",
      "\n",
      "“A broken leg” is health information.\n",
      "“Mr. Jones has a broken leg” is individually identifiable health information.\n",
      "If a covered entity records “Mr. Jones has a broken leg” the health information is protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where do Business Associates Enter the Equation?\n",
      "As well as covered entities having to understand what is considered PHI under HIPAA, it is also important that business associates are aware of how PHI is defined. This is because any individually identifiable health information created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a business associate in the provision of a service for or on behalf of a covered entity is also protected.\n",
      "Business associates are required to comply with the Security and Breach Notification Rules when providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity. However, depending on the nature of service being provided, business associates may also need to comply with parts of the Administrative Requirements and the Privacy Rule depending on the content of the Business Associate Agreement.\n",
      "When is PHI not PHI?\n",
      "There is a common misconception that all health information is considered PHI under HIPAA, but this is not the case.\n",
      "First, it depends on whether an identifier is included in the same record set. Under HIPAA, PHI ceases to be PHI if it is stripped of all identifiers that can tie the information to an individual. If identifiers are removed, the health information is referred to as de-identified PHI. HIPAA does not apply to de-identified PHI, and the information can be used or disclosed without violating any HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "Health information is also not PHI when it is created, received, maintained, or transmitted by an entity not subject to the HIPAA Rules. For example, even though schools and colleges may have medical facilities, health information relating to students is covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) which classifies students´ health information as part of their educational records.\n",
      "Health information maintained by employers as part of an employee´s employment record is not considered PHI under HIPAA. However, employers that administer a self-funded health plan do have to meet certain requirements with regards to keeping employment records separate from health plan records in order to avoid impermissible disclosures of PHI.\n",
      "It is important to be aware that exceptions to these examples exist. One of the most complicated examples relates to developers, vendors, and service providers for personal health devices that create, collect, maintain, or transmit health information. Entities related to personal health devices are not covered entities or business associates under HIPAA unless they are contracted to provide a service for or on behalf of a covered entity or business associate.\n",
      "However, entities related to personal health devices are required to comply with the Breach Notification Rule under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act if a breach of unsecured PHI occurs. This means that, although entities related to personal health devices do not have to comply with the Privacy and Security Rules, it is necessary for these entities to know what is considered PHI under HIPAA in order to comply with the Breach Notification Rule.\n",
      "The complexity of determining if information is considered PHI under HIPAA implies that both medical and non-medical workforce members should receive HIPAA training on the definition of PHI. It is also important for all members of the workforce to know which standards apply when state laws offer greater protections to PHI or have more individual rights than HIPAA, as these laws will preempt HIPAA.\n",
      "What is Considered PHI Under HIPAA FAQs\n",
      "What are the 18 HIPAA Identifiers?\n",
      "The 18 HIPAA identifiers are the identifiers that must be removed from a record set before any remaining health information is considered to be de-identified under the “safe harbor” method of de-identification (see §164.514). However, due to the age of the list, it is no longer a reliable guide. Since the list was first published in 1999, there are now many more ways to identify an individual,\n",
      "Importantly, if a Covered Entity removes all the listed identifiers from a designated record set, the subject of the health information might be able to be identified through other identifiers not included on the list – for example, social media aliases, LBGTQ statuses, details about an emotional support animal, etc. Therefore, Covered Entities should ensure no further identifiers remain in a record set before disclosing health information to a third party (i.e., to researchers).\n",
      "Also, because the list of 18 HIPAA identifiers is more than two decades out of date, the list should not be used to explain what is considered PHI under HIPAA – notwithstanding that any of these identifiers maintained separately from individually identifiable health information are not PHI in most circumstances and do not assume the Privacy Rule protections.\n",
      "What is PHI under HIPAA?\n",
      "PHI under HIPAA is individually identifiable health information that is collected or maintained by an organization that qualifies as a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate. Additionally, any information maintained in the same designated record set that identifies – or could be used with other information to identify – the subject of the health information is also PHI under HIPAA.\n",
      "What does PHI include?\n",
      "PHI includes information about an individual´s physical or mental health condition, the treatment of that condition, or the payment for the treatment. Additionally, PHI includes any information maintained in the same record set that identifies – or that could be used to identify – the subject of the health, treatment, or payment information.\n",
      "What are examples of PHI?\n",
      "Examples of PHI include test results, x-rays, scans, physician’s notes, diagnoses, treatments, eligibility approvals, claims, and remittances. When combined with this information, PHI also includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, Medicare Beneficiary Numbers, biometric identifiers, emotional support animals, and any other identifying information.\n",
      "Which format of PHI records is covered by HIPAA?\n",
      "All formats of PHI records are covered by HIPAA. These include (but are not limited to) spoken PHI, PHI written on paper, electronic PHI, and physical or digital images that could identify the subject of health information. It is important to remember that PHI records are only covered by HIPAA when they are in the possession of a covered entity or business associate.\n",
      "What is the difference between PHI and ePHI?\n",
      "The different between PHI and ePHI is that ePHI refers to Protected Health Information that is created, used, shared, or stored electronically – for example on an Electronic Health Record, in the content of an email, or in a cloud database. Both PHI and ePHI are subject to the same protections under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, while the HIPAA Security Rule mostly relates to ePHI.\n",
      "Does the Privacy Rule apply to both paper and electronic health information?\n",
      "The Privacy Rule applies to both paper and electronic health information despite the language used in the original Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act leading to a misconception that HIPAA only applies to electronic health records. While the protection of electronic health records was addressed in the HIPAA Security Rule, the Privacy Rule applies to all types of health information regardless of whether it is stored on paper or electronically, or communicated orally.\n",
      "If an individual calls a dental surgery to make an appointment and leaves their name and telephone number, is that PHI?\n",
      "If an individual calls a dental surgery to make an appointment and leaves their name and telephone number, the name and telephone number are not PHI at that time because there is no health information associated with them. Only once the individual undergoes treatment, and their name and telephone number are added to the treatment record, does that information become Protected Health Information.\n",
      "How can future health information about medical conditions be considered “protected”?\n",
      "Future health information about medical conditions can be considered protected if it includes prognoses, treatment plans, and rehabilitation plans that – if altered, deleted, or accessed without authorization – could have significant implications for a patient. For this reason, future health information must be protected in the same way as past or present health information.\n",
      "Does the Privacy Rule apply when medical professionals are discussing a patient´s healthcare?\n",
      "The Privacy Rule does apply when medical professionals are discussing a patient’s healthcare because, although PHI can be shared without authorization for the provision of treatment, when medical professionals discuss a patient´s healthcare, it must be done in private (i.e. not within earshot of the general public) and the Minimum Necessary Standard applies – the rule that limits the sharing of PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.\n",
      "If a medical professional discusses a patient´s treatment with the patient´s employer, is that information protected?\n",
      "If a medical professional discusses a patient’s treatment with the patient’s employer whether or not the information is protected depends on the circumstances. Usually, a patient will have to give their consent for a medical professional to discuss their treatment with an employer unless the discussion concerns payment for treatment or the employer is acting as an intermediary between the patient and a health plan.\n",
      "However, disclosures of PHI to employers are permitted under the Privacy Rule if the information being discussed relates to a workplace injury or illness. In such circumstances, a medical professional is permitted to disclose the information required by the employer to fulfil state or OSHA reporting requirements. In these circumstances, medical professionals can discuss a patient’s treatment with the patient’s employer without an authorization.\n",
      "Is an email PHI?\n",
      "Whether or not an email is PHI depends on who the email is sent by, what the email contains, and where it is stored. To be PHI, an email has to be sent by a Covered Entity or Business Associate, contain individually identifiable health information, and be stored by a Covered Entity or Business Associate in a designated record set with an identifier (if the email does not already include one).\n",
      "What is PHI is healthcare?\n",
      "PHI in healthcare stands for Protected Health Information – information protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule to ensure it remains private. PHI in healthcare can only be used or disclosed for permitted purposes without a patient´s authorization, and patients have the right to complain to HHS’ Office for Civil Rights if they believe a healthcare provider is failing to protect the privacy of their PHI.\n",
      "What are HIPAA identifiers?\n",
      "HIPAA identifiers are pieces of information that can be used – either separately or with other pieces of information – to identify an individual whose health information is protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Several sources confuse HIPAA identifiers with PHI, but it is important to be aware identifiers not maintained with an individual´s health information do not have the same protection as PHI.\n",
      "What qualifies as PHI?\n",
      "What qualifies as PHI is individually identifiable health information and any identifying non-health information stored in the same designated record set. Please note that a Covered Entity can maintain multiple designated record sets about the same individual and that a designated record set can consist of a single item (i.e., a picture of a baby on a pediatrician’s baby wall qualifies as PHI).\n",
      "Is a medical record number PHI?\n",
      "A medical record number is PHI is it can identify the individual in receipt of medical treatment. However, a seemingly random alpha-numeric code by itself (which medical record numbers often are) does not necessarily identify an individual if the code is not proceeded with “medical record number”, or accompanied by a name or any other information that could be used to identify the individual.\n",
      "What does PHI include?\n",
      "PHI includes individually identifiable health information maintained by a Covered Entity or Business Associate that relates to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health condition, treatment for the condition, or payment for the treatment. It can also include any non-health information that could be used to identify the subject of the PHI.\n",
      "Is a person’s gender PHI?\n",
      "A person’s gender is PHI if it is maintained in the same designated record set as individually identifiable health information by a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate as it could be used with other information to identify the subject of the individually identifiable health information. However, if a person’s gender is maintained in a data set that does not include individually identifiable health information (i.e., a transportation directory), it is not PHI.\n",
      "Is a patient’s name alone considered PHI?\n",
      "A patient’s name alone is not considered PHI. Only when a patient’s name is included in a designated record set with individually identifiable health information by a Covered Entity or Business Associate is it considered PHI under HIPAA.\n",
      "Under the Privacy Rule which information should be considered PHI?\n",
      "Under the Privacy Rule, the information that should be considered PHI relates to any identifiers that can be used to identify the subject of individually identifiable health information. However, where several sources mistake what is considered PHI under HIPAA is by ignoring the definitions of PHI in the General Provisions at the start of the Administrative Simplification Regulations (45 CFR Part 160).\n",
      "Is there a list of PHI identifiers?\n",
      "There is no list of PHI identifiers in HIPAA – only an out-of-date list of identifiers that have to be removed from a designated record set under the safe harbor method before any PHI remaining in the designated record set is deidentified. Because the list is so out-of-date and excludes many ways in which individuals can now be identified, Covered Entities and Business Associates are advised to have a full understanding of what is considered PHI under HIPAA before developing staff policies.\n",
      "Is a phone number PHI?\n",
      "A phone number is PHI if it is maintained in a designated record set by a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate because it could be used to identify the subject of any individually identifiable health information maintained in the same record set. However, if a phone number is maintained in a database that does not include individually identifiable health information, it is not PHI.\n",

      "How to Become HIPAA Compliant\n",
      "HIPAA rules and regulations can be very confusing for healthcare professionals tasked with ensuring HIPAA compliance at their organization.\n",
      "With that in mind, we have compiled this simple guide, which should ideally be used in conjunction with the HIPAA Compliance Checklist.\n",
      "Tips For Effective HIPAA Compliance\n",
      "In 2011, the the HHS published “The Seven Fundamental Elements Of An Effective Compliance Program”. We have slightly amended it to be more relevant to HIPAA compliance in 2023.\n",
      "Here is a summary of the elements, which we outline in more detail in this guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Develop policies and procedures so that day-to-day activities comply with the Privacy Rule.\n",
      "Designate a Privacy Officer and a Security Officer.\n",
      "Implement effective training programs.\n",
      "Ensure channels of communication exist to report violations, and breaches.\n",
      "Monitor compliance at floor level so poor compliance practices can be nipped in the bud.\n",
      "Enforce sanctions policies fairly and equally.\n",
      "Respond promptly to identified or reported violations, and breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Please use the form on this page to arrange to receive a free copy of the HIPAA Compliance Checklist.\n",
      "You can also read more about the background and history of the Seven Elements here, although this is not necessary.\n",
      "Next we go over each element in more detail\n",
      "Element 1: Why Privacy Rule Policies and Procedures?\n",
      "Although HIPAA compliance consists of complying with all relevant Administrative Simplification Regulations, implementing Security Rule and Breach Notification standards is generally an organizational process not connected with cultivating a culture of compliance. Additionally, the most common HIPAA violations are attributable to failures to comply with the Privacy Rule.\n",
      "However, it is no longer sufficient to develop policies and procedures that only address permissible uses and disclosures, the minimum necessary standard, and patients’ rights. Covered Entities should ensure Privacy Rule policies and procedures include how to explain to patients what PHI is (and what it isn’t), how to verify an individual’s identity, and how to record requests for privacy protections.\n",
      "Element 2: The Roles of HIPAA Compliance Officers\n",
      "It is interesting that the HHS’ Office of Inspector General placed this “tip” in second place after the development of policies and procedures. This would imply the roles of HIPAA compliance officers are to train members of the workforce, monitor compliance, and enforce the organization’s sanctions policy. However, there is quite a lot more involved in being a compliance officer.\n",
      "In most cases, the HIPAA Privacy Officer will be the point of contact for members of the public and members of the workforce that want to report privacy concerns. Security Officers are generally more responsible for conducting risk assessments, ensuring security solutions are configured properly, and training members of the workforce on how to use the solutions compliantly.\n",

      "Element 3: What Makes an Effective Training Program?\n",
      "The effectiveness of the training provided to members of the workforce can make the difference between ticking the box of compliance or cultivating a culture of compliance. To make Privacy Rule training effective, members of the workforce must understand what PHI is, why it has to be protected, and the consequences to patients, employers, and themselves of HIPAA violations.\n",
      "Security Rule training must be even more focused on the consequences of taking shortcuts, circumnavigating safeguards, and failing to alert managers of a data breach for fear of “getting into trouble”. One way of achieving this is to ask members of the workforce to run personal online credentials through the HIBP database to illustrate the importance of unique, complex passwords.\n",
      "Element 4: The Importance of Two-Way Communication\n",
      "While policy making and training has to come from the top down, it is important that any channels of communication relating to HIPAA compliance are also bottom up – not only to raise compliance concerns or report HIPAA violations, but also to provide feedback on what works and what doesn’t on the ground floor, and what new challenges are facing frontline members of the workforce.\n",
      "This is why it can be important – when resources allow – to have a compliance team consisting of team members that have worked in or have knowledge of how different departments operate. For example, a compliance team consisting solely of lawyers and IT managers may not appreciate the difficulty of protecting the privacy of PHI in front of a grieving family mourning a recent loss.\n",
      "Element 5: How Most Poor Compliance Practices Develop\n",
      "Most poor compliance practices result from well-meaning intentions – for example, to “get the job done” or provide a good service to a patient’s family. When minor violations are allowed to continue, poor compliance practices can develop into a culture of non-compliance. This is why it is important identify and address poor compliance practices at the earliest opportunity.\n",
      "While it is important to have eyes on compliance at floor level, it is also important not to take eyes off compliance at higher levels. Busy managers and senior managers can also be guilty of taking shortcuts with compliance or ignoring non-compliant activities because they do not have the time to “sort it out” – when, in truth, the failure to take action is a failure of management.\n",

      "Element 6: The Best Sanctions are Not Always Disciplinary\n",
      "Sanctions policies can often be overwhelming documents threatening all manner of disciplinary actions for non-compliance from warnings to suspensions, to termination of contract and loss of license. Some even include the maximum federal penalties for violations of §1177 of the Social Security Act (up to ten years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines).\n",
      "Although these sanctions may have to legally be included in a sanctions policy, making them the focus of attention is not necessarily the best way to cultivate a culture of compliance. The threat of additional training is often sufficient to create and maintain a compliant workforce – especially if whole teams have to attend refresher training due to the non-compliance of an individual!\n",
      "Element 7: Responding Quickly is the Key to Compliance\n",
      "One of the keys to cultivating a culture of compliance is to respond to queries, issues, complaints, reports of violations, and data breaches as quickly as possible. Responding quickly to any type of communication demonstrates a commitment to compliance and an eagerness to ensure – once a compliant workforce is achieved – the compliant state is maintained.\n",
      "Responding to queries, issues, complaints, etc. would ordinarily be the responsibility of compliance officers (or teams), but this can lead to the compliance officers being overwhelmed. Consequently, it may be necessary for managers and senior managers to take some responsibility for monitoring compliance and responding to workforce or patient communications.\n",

      "Penalties for HIPAA violations can be issued by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and state attorneys general.\n",

      "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 placed a number of requirements on HIPAA-covered entities to safeguard the Protected Health Information (PHI) of patients, and to strictly control when PHI can be divulged, and to whom.\n",
      "Since the Enforcement Final Rule of 2006, OCR has had the power to issue financial penalties (and/or corrective action plans) to HIPAA-covered entities that fail to comply with HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "Financial penalties for HIPAA violations were updated by the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, which introduced charges in line with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). The Omnibus Rule took effect on March 26, 2013.\n",

      "Since the introduction of the Omnibus Rule, the new penalties for HIPAA violations apply to healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and all other covered entities, as well as to business associates (BAs) of covered entities that are found to have violated HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "Financial penalties are intended to act as a deterrent to prevent the violation of HIPAA laws, while also ensuring covered entities are held accountable for their actions – or lack of them – when it comes to protecting the privacy of patients and the confidentiality of health data, and providing patients with access to their health records on request.\n",
      "The penalty structure for a violation of HIPAA laws is tiered, based on the knowledge a covered entity had of the violation. The OCR sets the penalty based on a number of “general factors” and the seriousness of the HIPAA violation.\n",
      "Ignorance of HIPAA Rules is no excuse for failing to comply with HIPAA Rules. It is the responsibility of each covered entity to ensure that HIPAA Rules are understood and followed. In cases when a covered entity is discovered to committed a willful violation of HIPAA laws, the maximum fines may apply.\n",
      "What Constitutes a HIPAA Violation?\n",
      "There is much talk of HIPAA violations in the media, but what constitutes a HIPAA violation? A HIPAA violation is when a HIPAA-covered entity – or a business associate – fails to comply with one or more of the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, or Breach Notification Rules.\n",
      "A violation may be deliberate or unintentional. An example of an unintentional HIPAA violation is when too much PHI is disclosed and the minimum necessary information standard is violated. When PHI is disclosed, it must be limited to the minimum necessary information to achieve the purpose for which it is disclosed. Financial penalties for HIPAA violations can be issued for unintentional HIPAA violations, although the penalties will be at a lower rate to willful violations of HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "An example of a deliberate violation is unnecessarily delaying the issuing of breach notification letters to patients and exceeding the maximum timeframe of 60 days following the discovery of a breach to issue notifications – A violation of the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.\n",
      "Many HIPAA violations are the result of negligence, such as the failure to perform an organization-wide risk assessment. Financial penalties for HIPAA violations have frequently been issued for risk assessment failures.\n",
      "Penalties for HIPAA violations can potentially be issued for all HIPAA violations, although OCR typically resolves most cases through voluntary HIPAA compliance, issuing technical guidance, or accepting a covered entity or business associate’s plan to address the violations and change policies and procedures to prevent future violations from occurring. Financial penalties for HIPAA violations are reserved for the most serious violations of HIPAA Rules and for when OCR wants to “send a message” about specific violation types.\n",
      "What Happens if You Violate HIPAA? – HIPAA Violation Classifications\n",
      "What happens if you violate HIPAA? That depends on the severity of the violation. OCR prefers to resolve HIPAA violations using non-punitive measures, such as voluntary compliance or issuing technical guidance to help covered entities address areas of non-compliance. However, if the violations are serious, have been allowed to persist for a long time, or if there are multiple areas of noncompliance, financial penalties may be appropriate.\n",
      "The four categories used for the penalty structure are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tier 1: A violation that the covered entity was unaware of and could not have realistically avoided, had a reasonable amount of care had been taken to abide by HIPAA Rules\n",
      "Tier 2: A violation that the covered entity should have been aware of but could not have avoided even with a reasonable amount of care. (but falling short of willful neglect of HIPAA Rules)\n",
      "Tier 3: A violation suffered as a direct result of “willful neglect” of HIPAA Rules, in cases where an attempt has been made to correct the violation\n",
      "Tier 4: A violation of HIPAA Rules constituting willful neglect, where no attempt has been made to correct the violation within 30 days\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of unknown violations, where the covered entity could not have been expected to avoid a data breach, it may seem unreasonable for a covered entity to be issued with a fine. OCR appreciates this and has the discretion to waive a financial penalty. The penalty cannot be waived if the violation involved willful neglect of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.\n",
      "HIPAA Violation Penalty Structure\n",
      "Each category of violation carries a separate HIPAA penalty. It is up to OCR to determine a financial penalty within the appropriate range. OCR considers a number of factors when determining penalties, such as the length of time a violation was allowed to persist, the number of people affected, and the nature of the data exposed. An organization’s willingness to assist with an OCR investigation is also taken into account. The general factors that can affect the amount of the financial penalty also include prior history, the organization’s financial condition, and the level of harm caused by the violation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tier 1: Minimum fine of $100 per violation up to $50,000\n",
      "Tier 2: Minimum fine of $1,000 per violation up to $50,000\n",
      "Tier 3: Minimum fine of $10,000 per violation up to $50,000\n",
      "Tier 4: Minimum fine of $50,000 per violation\n",
      "\n",
      "The above fines for HIPAA violations are those stipulated by the HITECH Act. It should be noted that these are adjusted annually to take inflation into account. The last official update to apply the inflation increases was in March 2022. The table below lists the 2022 penalties. The table will be updated to include the multiplier for 2023 when it is officially applied. The 2023 multiplier is 1.07745.\n",

      "A data breach or security incident that results from any violation could see separate fines issued for different aspects of the breach under multiple security and privacy standards. A fine of $60,973 could, in theory, be issued for any violation of HIPAA rules; however minor.\n",
      "A fine may also be applied on a daily basis. For example, if a covered entity has been denying patients the right to obtain copies of their medical records, and had been doing so for a period of one year, the OCR may decide to apply a penalty per day that the covered entity has been in violation of the law. The penalty would be multiplied by 365, not by the number of patients that have been refused access to their medical records.\n",
      "OCR 2019 Notice of Enforcement Discretion Applies New Maximum Annual Penalties for HIPAA Violations\n",
      "The above table of penalties is still officially in force; however, in 2019, the HHS reviewed the language of the HITECH Act with respect to the required increases for HIPAA violations and determined that the language of the HITECH Act had been misinterpreted and that it did not call for the same maximum annual penalty cap to be applied equally across all four penalty tiers. Instead, the HHS determined that the maximum annual penalty of $1.5 million ($1,919,173 in 2022) should only apply to the most serious Tier 4 violation category.\n",
      "Rather than issue further rulemaking which would see the new penalty structure changed in the Federal Register, the HHS announced that OCR would be exercising enforcement discretion and would be applying a different penalty structure where each tier had a separate annual penalty cap. A Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NED) was issued in April 2019 which states that OCR will apply penalties according to the table below indefinitely, although the new penalty structure will not be legally binding until changes are made to the Federal Register. Since the NED only applied caps to the annual penalties, there is an anomaly. The maximum penalty per violation in Tier 1 is higher than the annual penalty cap, but the cap for that tier applies. This anomaly is likely to be addressed through HHS rulemaking to make the change permanent.\n",

The multiplier for 2023, when it is officially applied, will be 1.07745.\n",
      "Attorneys General Can Also Issue HIPAA Violation Fines\n",
      "Since the introduction of the HITECH Act (Section 13410(e) (1)) in February 2009, state attorneys general have the authority to hold HIPAA-covered entities accountable for the unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI of state residents and can file civil actions with the federal district courts. HIPAA violation fines can be issued up to a maximum level of $25,000 per violation category, per calendar year. The minimum fine applicable is $100 per violation.\n",
      "A covered entity suffering a data breach affecting residents in multiple states may be ordered to pay HIPAA violation fines to attorneys general in multiple states. Relatively few states have taken action against HIPAA-regulated entities for violations of the HIPAA Rules – California, Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and the District of Columbia. In recent years attorneys general have joined forces and have pursued penalties for HIPAA violations in response to large-scale data breaches that have affected individuals across the United States, and have pooled their resources and taken a cut of any settlements or civil monetary penalties. While only a small number of states have exercised their authority to issue fines for HIPAA violations, that does not mean HIPAA violations are going unpunished. Many states have pursued financial penalties for equivalent violations of state laws.\n",
      "Can HIPAA Violations be Criminal?\n",
      "When a HIPAA-covered entity or business associate violates HIPAA Rules, civil penalties can be imposed. When healthcare professionals violate HIPAA, it is usually their employer that receives the penalty, but not always. If healthcare professionals knowingly obtain or use protected health information for reasons that are not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, they may be found to be criminally liable for the HIPAA violation under the criminal enforcement provision of the Social Security Act.\n",
      "Criminal HIPAA violations are prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which is increasingly taking action against individuals that have knowingly violated HIPAA Rules. There have been several cases that have resulted in substantial fines and prison sentences.\n",
      "Criminal HIPAA violations include theft of patient information for financial gain and wrongful disclosures with intent to cause harm. A lack of understanding of HIPAA requirements may not be a valid defense. When an individual “knowingly” violates HIPAA, knowingly means that they have some knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense, not that they definitely know that they are violating HIPAA Rules.\n",
      "Criminal Penalties for HIPAA Violations\n",
      "Criminal penalties for HIPAA violations are divided into three separate tiers, with the term – and an accompanying fine – decided by a judge based on the facts of each individual case. As with OCR, a number of general factors are considered which will affect the penalty issued. If an individual has profited from the theft, access, or disclosure of PHI, it may be necessary for all money received to be refunded, in addition to the payment of a fine.\n",
      "The tiers of criminal penalties for HIPAA violations are:\n",
      "Tier 1:   Reasonable cause or no knowledge of violation – Up to 1 year in jail\n",
      "Tier 2:   Obtaining PHI under false pretenses – Up to 5 years in jail\n",
      "Tier 3:   Obtaining PHI for personal gain or with malicious intent – Up to 10 years in jail\n",
      "In recent years, the number of employees discovered to be accessing or stealing PHI – for various reasons – has increased. The value of PHI on the black market is considerable, and this can be a big temptation for some individuals. It is therefore essential that controls are put in place to limit the opportunity for individuals to steal patient data, and for systems and policies to be put in place to ensure improper access and theft of PHI is identified promptly.\n",
      "All staff likely to come into contact with PHI as part of their work duties should be informed of the HIPAA criminal penalties and that violations will not only result in loss of employment but potentially also a lengthy jail term and a heavy fine.\n",
      "State attorneys general are cracking down on data theft and are keen to make examples out of individuals found to have violated HIPAA Privacy Rules. A jail term for the theft of HIPAA data is therefore highly likely.\n",

      "UPMC Patient Care Coordinator Gets 1 Year Jail Term for HIPAA Violation\n",
      "Employee Sanctions for HIPAA Violations\n",
      "Not all HIPAA violations are a result of insider theft, and many Covered Entities and Business Associates apply a scale of employee sanctions for HIPAA violations depending on factors such as whether the violation was intentional or accidental, whether it was reported by the employee as soon as the violation was realized,  and the magnitude of the breach. Some Covered Entities also apply employee sanctions for HIPAA violations on employees who were aware a violation (by another employee) had occurred but failed to report it.\n",
      "Employee sanctions for HIPAA violations vary in gravity from further training to dismissal. The decision should be taken in consultation with HIPAA Privacy and Security Officers, who may have to conduct interviews with the employee, investigate audit trails, and review telephone logs – including the telephone logs of the employee´s mobile phone. Because of the expense and disruption attributable to applying employee sanctions for HIPAA violations, it is worthwhile dedicating more resources to initial employee training in order to prevent HIPAA violations – whether intentional or accidental – from occurring.\n",
      "Receiving a Civil Penalty for Unknowingly Violating HIPAA\n",
      "Although it was mentioned above that OCR has the discretion to waive a civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA, ignorance of HIPAA regulations is not regarded as a justifiable excuse for failing to implement the appropriate safeguards. In April 2017, the remote cardiac monitoring service CardioNet was fined $2.5 million for failing to fully understand the HIPAA requirements and subsequently failing to conduct a complete risk assessment.\n",
      "As a result of the incomplete risk assessment, the PHI of 1,391 individuals was potentially disclosed without authorization when a laptop containing the data was stolen from a car parked outside an employee´s home. Speaking after details of the fine had been announced, OCR Director Roger Severino described the civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA as a penalty for disregarding security.\n",
      "It may also be possible for a CE or BA to receive a civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA if the state in which the violation occurs allows individuals to bring legal action against the person(s) responsible for the violation. Although HIPAA lacks a private right of action, individuals can still use state regulations to establish a standard of care under common law. Several cases of this nature are currently in progress.\n",
      "Penalties for Non-Compliance with HIPAA\n",
      "\n",
      "When deciding on an appropriate settlement, OCR considers the severity of the violation, the extent of non-compliance with HIPAA Rules, the number of individuals impacted, and the impact a breach has had on those individuals. OCR also considers the financial position of the covered entity. Punitive measures may be necessary, but penalties for HIPAA violations should not result in a covered entity being forced out of business.\n",
      "The purpose of these penalties for HIPAA violations is in part to punish covered entities for serious violations of HIPAA Rules, but also to send a message to other healthcare organizations that noncompliance with HIPAA Rules is not acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "HIPAA Penalties 2023\n",
      "OCR is expected to continue to aggressively enforce HIPAA compliance in 2023 after a record-breaking year of HIPAA fines and settlements. OCR is continuing to crack down on violations of the HIPAA Right of Access, which has been one of OCR’s main enforcement priority priorities since the agency launched its HIPAA Right of Access initiative in late 2019. The majority of enforcement actions for HIPAA violations in the past two years have been for HIPAA Right of Access violations. OCR has confirmed its intent to continue to enforce this aspect of HIPAA compliance with an early HIPAA penalty in 2023.\n",
      "In 2018, OCR announced an enforcement action against University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for a data breach and lack of encryption, but the penalty was overturned on appeal. On January 14, 2021, a three-member panel for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously vacated the $4,348,000 penalty, and since that date, only a handful of HIPAA penalties have been issued for violations of the HIPAA Rules other than HIPAA Right of Access failures. The decision by the Court of Appeals was widely thought to have affected OCR’s willingness to pursue financial penalties for certain HIPAA violations, but in 2022, multiple financial penalties were imposed for other HIPAA violations. OCR now has a new Director, Melanie Fontes Rainer, who was appointed on September 14, 2022, as the successor to Lisa J. Pino. Fontes Rainer will oversee the department’s enforcement activities and is expected to stamp her mark on enforcement, and we may well see a change in the HIPAA violation cases in 2023 that result in financial penalties.\n",
      "From a compliance perspective, there are several points that are worth making for 2023. HIPAA-covered entities that provide telehealth services need to ensure that when the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency is declared over, the platforms they use for telehealth are HIPAA-compliant, as OCR’s Notice of Enforcement Discretion regarding the good faith provision of telehealth services will also come to an end. OCR issued guidance in 2022 confirming that breach notifications need to be issued within 60 days of the discovery of a data breach, which could indicate this aspect of compliance will be more aggressively enforced, and it is also likely that OCR will be scrutinizing the use of website tracking technologies now that guidance has been issued for healthcare providers confirming patient authorizations and business associate agreements are required.\n",
      "This post will be updated as and when the 2023 HIPAA penalties are announced and 2023 HIPAA enforcement trends become clear.\n",

OCR has continued with its 2019 HIPAA enforcement initiative targeting noncompliance with the HIPAA Right of Access, with the 2022 total bringing the number of enforcement actions under this initiative up to 42. Financial penalties were also imposed for impermissible disclosures of patient information on social media websites, inadequate security safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, inadequate notices of privacy practices, and risk analysis failures.\n",
      "In January 2021, the HITECH Act was amended to incentivize HIPAA-regulated entities to adopt ‘recognized security practices’ to better protect patient data. While it is not mandatory for recognized security practices to be implemented and maintained, HIPAA-regulated entities that demonstrate that they have implemented recognized security practices that have been in place continuously for the 12 months preceding a data breach will benefit from lower financial penalties, and shorter audits and investigations.\n",

The settlement resolved a HIPAA case that stemmed from an investigation of a breach of the PHI of 9,358,891 individuals that was reported to OCR in 2015. Aside from that penalty, most of the settlements and civil monetary penalties have been for relatively small amounts and have resulted from investigations of complaints from patients than reports of data breaches. As well as the 2021 HIPAA fines being lower, there was a much higher percentage of financial penalties imposed on small healthcare providers than in previous years.

      "What are the Penalties for HIPAA Violations? FAQs\n",
      "What is the maximum penalty for violating HIPAA?\n",
      "The maximum penalty for violating HIPAA per violation is currently $1,919,173. However, it is rare that an event that results in the maximum penalty being issued is attributable to a single violation. For example, a data breach could be attributable to the failure to conduct a risk analysis, the failure to provide a security awareness training program, and a failure to prevent password sharing.\n",
      "What are the consequences of a HIPAA violation?\n",
      "The consequences of a HIPAA violation depend on the nature of the violation, the reason(s) behind it, the amount of harm it causes, and the organization´s previous history of compliance. In most cases, HIPAA violations are not attributable to willful neglect and HHS´ Office for Civil Rights will try to resolve first-time HIPAA violations via technical assistance or a corrective action plan.\n",
      "What is the civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA?\n",
      "The civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA is no different from knowingly violating HIPAA. As mentioned in the above article, there is no excuse for unknowingly violating HIPAA. The Privacy and Security Rules have been in existence for more than twenty years; and, to quote OCR Director Roger Severino “the civil penalty for unknowingly violating HIPAA is a penalty for disregarding security”.\n",
      "What are the categories for punishing violations of federal health care laws?\n",
      "The categories for punishing violations of federal health care laws vary considerably depending on which law is being violated or which section of which law is being violated. For example, with regards to the penalties for HIPAA violations, there are four civil categories for punishing violations and three criminal categories. However, in other federal health care laws (for example, the Social Security Act), there can be dozens of categories for punishing violations of federal health care laws.\n",
      "What criminal consequences are possible with a Tier 3 violation?\n",
      "The criminal consequences possible with a Tier 3 violation – wrongfully and knowingly obtaining PHI for personal gain, commercial advantage, or with malicious intent – are up to ten years in jail and/or a fine of up to $250,000. These penalties are pursued by the Department of Justice rather than HHS´ Office for Civil Rights.\n",
      "What are the fines for HIPAA violations?\n",
      "The fines for HIPAA violations (per violation – as of January 2023) are:\n",
      "Tier 1 – from $127 to $30,487\n",
      "Tier 2 – from $1,280 to $60,973\n",
      "Tier 3 – from $12,794 to $60,973\n",
      "Tier 4 – from $60,973 to $1,919,173\n",
      "It is important to be aware that, in addition to the fines for HIPAA violations issued by HHS´ Office for Civil Rights, State Attorneys General can issue additional fines for HIPAA violations. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the violation(s), it may be possible for affected individuals to bring a class action lawsuit against an organization guilty of a HIPAA violation.\n",
      "What does a corrective action plan consist of?\n",
      "A corrective action plan consists of measures to address the underlying issue(s) that led to a HIPAA violation(s) and therefore what the action plan consists of will be relevant to the nature of the violation(s). Typically, Covered Entities and Business Associates will be required to develop or revise policies to fill gaps in their compliance; and, when new or revised policies affect the functions of the workforce, provide training on the new or revised policies.\n",
      "Are penalties for HIPAA violations always related to data breaches?\n",
      "Penalties for HIPAA violations are not always related to data breaches. As you will see from the tables above, several Covered Entities have been fined or reached settlement resolutions for failing to provide patients with access to healthcare records within the permitted 30 days. One Covered Entity was fined for failing to have a Business Associate Agreement in place before disclosing ePHI to a Business Associate. None of these penalties for HIPAA violations involved a breach of unsecured PHI.\n",
      "How does the Office for Civil Rights find out about HIPAA violations?\n",
      "The Office for Civil Rights finds out about HIPAA violations in a number of ways. For example, Covered Entities are required to report breaches of unsecured PHI within 60 days (or annually if the breach involves fewer than 500 patients), patients can use the OCR complaints portal to report a delay or refusal to access health information, and members of Covered Entities´ workforces are granted whistleblower protection for reporting non-compliance.\n",
      "What if a violation occurs due to a common non-compliant practice?\n",
      "If a HIPAA violation occurs due to a common non-compliant practice, the penalty will depend on the nature of the violation, the consequences of the violation, and the perpetrator’s previous compliance history. Most often, a penalty will consist of refresher training and a compliance monitoring program – potentially by a third-party organization at the organization´s own cost.\n",
      "Are HIPAA violations criminal?\n",
      "HIPAA violations are criminal when an individual wrongfully disclosures individually identifiable health information knowingly. In such cases, a violation can be referred to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation. If the individual is found guilty of a criminal offense under § 1320d-6 of the Social Security Act, they can be fined up to $250,000 and sentenced to up to ten years in jail.\n",
      "Has anybody ever received a custodial sentence for violating HIPAA?\n",
      "A custodial sentence for violating HIPAA is rare, but it has happened – for example, when an employee has been found guilty of stealing PHI to commit identify theft or to sell for personal gain. Even when a violation does not result in a custodial sentence, the offending employee will likely be fined, lose their job, and have their license to practice withdrawn. Depending on how the employee accessed the data, Covered Entities and Business Associates can also be fined for the same violation.\n",
      "Who issues HIPAA violation fines?\n",
      "HIPAA violation fines are most often issued by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights. However, fines for HIPAA violations can also be issued by State Attorneys General and the Federal Trade Commission; and – when the violation is criminal in nature – the Department of Justice can pursue criminal prosecutions against the perpetrators, which can also result in fines.\n",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also have the authority to issue fines for violations of the HIPAA Administrative Requirements (45 CFR Part 162). To date, CMS has not exercised this option – preferring instead to resolve violations of Part 162 with technical assistance and corrective action plans.\n",
      "Are HIPAA breach penalties always financial?\n",
      "HIPAA breach penalties are not always financial. In fact, HHS’ Office for Civil Rights has only issued financial penalties in around 2% of cases it has investigated for HIPAA breaches – and penalties issued by State Attorneys General and the FTC are even rarer. The majority of HIPAA breaches are resolved via voluntary compliance, technical assistance, or a corrective action plan.\n",
      "What HIPAA penalties are imposed by the State Attorneys General?\n",
      "HIPAA penalties can be imposed by the State Attorneys General when there is reason to believe residents of the state have been adversely affected by a violation of HIPAA. In such cases, State Attorneys General can bring a civil action on behalf of residents of the state, with penalties ranging from $100 per violation (per affected resident) to $25,000 per violation type (per affected resident).\n",
      "Can CMS issue fines for HIPAA violations?\n",
      "CMS can issue fines for HIPAA violations when the violation relates to the HIPAA Administrative Requirements (45 CFR Part 162). As yet, CMS has not exercised its authority to issue fines for HIPAA violations – instead resolving Part 162 complaints via voluntary compliance, technical assistance, and corrective action plans.\n",
      "When can the FTC issue HIPAA violation penalties?\n",
      "The FTC can issue HIPAA violation penalties when an individual or organization not covered by HIPAA experiences a data breach of unsecured PHI or fails to notify individuals following a data breach. Typically, organizations that create or maintain PHI that are not covered by HIPAA include vendors of personal health appliances and wearables that transmit data to/from the vendor’s servers.\n",
      "What is the penalty for a HIPAA violation by a hospital volunteer?\n",
      "The penalty for a HIPAA violation by a hospital volunteer is the same as if the violation was committed by a paid member of the workforce. Similarly, if a patient complains to HHS’ Office for Civil Rights – and the complaint is investigated – the investigation will not consider the employed status of the violator because Covered Entities are required to train all members of the workforce on HIPAA policies and procedures regardless of whether they are volunteers, students, or employees.\n",
      "How much is a HIPAA violation penalty?\n",
      "How much a HIPAA violation penalty is depends on the nature of the violation, the consequences of the violation, the perpetrator’s prior compliance history, their willingness to assist any investigation into the violation, and the speed at which measures re put in place to prevent the violation happening again. It can also be the case that HHS’ Office for Civil Rights uses a HIPAA violation penalty to “send a message” to other Covered Entities.\n",
      "What are the HIPAA violation consequences for a medical student?\n",
      "The HIPAA violation consequences for a medical student will depend on the sanctions policy at the healthcare facility they are working at. Usually – unless the HIPAA violation has serious consequences – the medical student will receive a verbal warning. However, the verbal warning will be recorded in their HR file and may affect future employment opportunities.\n",
      "Who sets HIPAA fines and penalties?\n",
      "HIPAA fines and penalties actually existed before HIPAA and originally related to fraudulent claims for treatment made by healthcare providers to federal agencies (i.e., Medicare). The fines and penalties were increased in the text of HIPAA, and applied to violations of the Privacy and Security Rules in 2005 when the Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) published the Enforcement Rule.\n",
      "The HIPAA fines and penalties were subsequently increased by Congress via the HITECH Act 2009, since 2015, the fines and penalties issued by HHS’ Office for Civil Rights have been adjusted annually to account for inflation. There have been no increases in the HIPAA fines and penalties that can be imposed by State Attorneys General since the passage of HITECH nor in the fines and penalties for criminal violations of HIPAA.\n",
      "Are HIPAA breach fines always the same for each type of violation?\n",
      "HIPAA breach fines can be the same for each type of violation but – under §160.408 of the Administrative Simplification provisions – the Secretary for Health and Human Services is required to take a number of factors into account when determining the amount of a HIPAA breach fine.\n",
      "What is the cost of a HIPAA violation?\n",
      "The cost of a HIPAA violation varies according to the nature of the violation, who is responsible for it, and what the consequences are. For example, a disclosure of more than the minimum necessary PHI by a member of a Covered Entity’s workforce who with no previous record of non-compliance will likely receive a verbal warning and may have to undergo further training at minimal cost.\n",
      "Conversely, a healthcare organization that willfully and knowingly neglects to implement the Security Rule safeguards, and consequently experiences a data breach affecting thousands of patients, will likely receive a multi-million dollar fine. Between the two extremes, most violations incur some degree of cost – whether it is reported internally or notified to HHS’ Office for Civil Rights.\n",
      "Can patients claim monetary damages for a HIPAA violation?\n",
      "Patients cannot claim monetary damages for a HIPAA violation under HIPAA law, but many states have privacy, security, and/or breach notification laws that do allow for a private right of action depending on the nature of the violation and the degree of harm suffered. If individuals feel they have suffered harm due to the negligence of a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate, they should seek independent legal advice from an attorney.\n",
      "What are HIPAA penalties for non-compliance?\n",
      "HIPAA penalties for non-compliance vary according to the nature of the violation, which section of HIPAA has been violated, and the consequences of the violation. The HIPAA penalties for non-compliance also vary according to who the non-compliant party is. For example, the penalties for non-compliance by a member of the workforce will likely be a verbal or written warning, while the penalties for non-compliance by a Covered Entity will range from technical assistance to a fine.\n",
      "What is the fine described by HIPAA/HITECH for companies which accidently release PHI but perform due diligence?\n",
      "The fine described by HIPAA/HITECH for companies which accidently release PHI but perform due diligence is a Tier 1 fine for the “Lack of Knowledge” level of culpability. At present (January 2023), the amount of the fine is between $127 per violation to $31,987 per violation – but these amounts will be adjusted for inflation during the year.\n",
      "What is the maximum fine per HIPAA violation according to the Final Omnibus Rule?\n",
      "The maximum fine per HIPAA violation according to the Final Omnibus Rule is $1.5 million. However, it is important to be aware that the tiered HIPAA penalty structure with the $1.5 million penalty cap was introduced by the HITECH Act in 2009 and adopted by the Final Omnibus Rule in 2013. Additionally, since 2015, the maximum fine per HIPAA violation has been increased each year to account for inflation.\n",
      "What are the criminal penalties for HIPAA violations?\n",
      "The criminal penalties for HIPAA violations vary according to the motive for the offence. According to §1177 of the Social Security Act, a person who obtains, discloses, uses – or causes to be used – individually identifiable health information maintained by a Covered Entity can be fined up to $50,000 and/or imprisoned for up to a year.\n",
      "However, if the offense is committed under false pretenses, the fine increases up to $100,000 and the prison term up to five years; and, if the offense is committed with the intent to sell, transfer, or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm, the fine increases up to $250,000 and the jail term up to ten years.\n",
      "What are the consequences of violating HIPAA for a nurse?\n",
      "The consequences of violating HIPAA for a nurse most often depend on the nature of the violation, the impact of the violation, the nurse’s previous compliance record, and the content of the Covered Entity’s sanctions policy. Typically, a first offense with a minor impact will result in a verbal warning and/or refresher training. However, the consequences of violating HIPAA for a nurse could escalate for a serious or repeated offense to a written warning, a suspension, or termination of employment.\n",
      "Are there HIPAA violation fines for individuals?\n",
      "There are not HIPAA violation fines for individuals unless an individual qualifies as a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate (i.e., a freelance counselor) and they violate HIPAA in their role as such. Individuals employed by Covered Entities or Business Associates cannot be fined for civil violations, but could be fined if a violation is considered criminal and referred to the Department of Justice.\n",
      "What is the minimum fine for intentional and uncorrected release of PHI?\n",
      "The minimum fine for intentional and uncorrected release of PHI is currently $63,973 if the offender is a Covered Entity or Business Associate. If the offender is a member of a Covered Entity’s or Business Associate’s workforce, and they violate HIPAA intentionally with criminal intent, there is no set minimum fine. The Courts can decide on a fine of up to $250,000.\n",
      "What are HIPAA civil monetary penalties?\n",
      "HIPAA civil monetary penalties are fines sometimes imposed on HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates for violations of HIPAA. The term can sometimes be shortened to HIPAA penalties, or HIPAA settlements when the perpetrator negotiates a settlement with HHS’ Office for Civil Rights to avoid a lengthy – and potentially costly – dispute over how the civil monetary penalties should be.\n",
      "Are HIPAA violations sanctioned differently in different states?\n",
      "HIPAA violations are not sanctioned differently in different states; although, in some areas, State Attorneys General are more willing to pursue HIPAA violation sanctions against a Covered Entity than in other states. This may be because the state has more stringent privacy or data security regulations than HIPAA, or because a significant number of state residents are impacted by HIPAA violations.\n",

      "Is Proton Mail HIPAA Compliant?\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 15, 2023\n",
      "Like most questions relating to HIPAA and technology, the answer to the question is Proton Mail HIPAA compliant is “it depends”. This is because no technology is HIPAA compliant. It is how the technology is configured and used that determines compliance with HIPAA.\n",
      "Proton Mail offers mail, storage, and VPN services, and claims to be “the world’s largest end-to-end encrypted email service”. The “end-to-end” part of the claim does a lot of heavy lifting because emails are only fully encrypted between Proton Mail users. If you send an encrypted email to a (say) Outlook user, you have to set a password for the recipient to open the email.\n",
      "Nonetheless, Proton Mail is an attractive option for businesses operating in regulated industries because of its zero-knowledge model and advanced privacy protections. It is also fairly easy to configure (compared to – for example – Microsoft365) and it is possible to “bridge” accounts between the Proton Mail client and third-party email service providers.\n",
      "Do Covered Entities Need Encrypted Email?\n",
      "Before considering is Proton Mail HIPAA compliant, it may be worth considering whether Covered Entities need encrypted email. This is because the Privacy and Security Rules do not stipulate that emails have to be encrypted – only that the privacy of PHI is protected and that measures are implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI.\n",
      "Therefore, although encrypted email services such as Proton Mail can prevent data breaches if emails are intercepted in transit or if a mail server is hacked, encrypted email services do not prevent emails containing PHI being sent to the wrong recipient, mail shots being sent with all recipients’ names in the “to” or “cc” boxes, or malicious insiders using encrypted email to steal PHI.\n",
      "Furthermore, HHS has issued guidance that it is okay to communicate PHI with a patient via unencrypted email provided the patient has not specifically requested to be contacted via a more secure channel. Indeed, the guidance states Covered Entities can assume a patient has given their consent to be contacted by unencrypted email if the patient has initiated contact in this manner.\n",
      "But Is Proton Mail HIPAA Compliant?\n",
      "For Covered Entities that feel encrypted email is an essential part of a multi-layered defense strategy, Proton Mail meets the physical, technical, and administrative safeguards required of a Business Associate and will enter into a Business Associate Agreement with Covered Entities – even though the vendor does not have access to the content of emails due to its zero knowledge model.\n",
      "All emails between Proton Mail users are encrypted by default, and the user-friendly Administrator’s Console makes it easy to onboard or remove users, manage user credentials, and control which users have access to Proton Drive storage volumes containing PHI. The console also allows administrators to force sign outs when user credentials are believed to have been compromised.\n",
      "In these respects, Proton Mail goes beyond the minimum requirements to support HIPAA compliance, and it could be said that Proton Mail is HIPAA compliant. However, users still have to be trained – and remember – to set a password for each recipient that is not a Proton Mail user, which may cause more compliance issues than not using an encrypted mail service to communicate PHI.\n",

      "HIPAA Continuity of Care\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 12, 2023\n",
      "Under HIPAA, continuity of care is not always as straightforward as it could be due to seemingly contradictory guidance issued by HHS’ Office of Civil Rights. Whereas the Privacy Rule would appear to allow disclosures of PHI for continuity of care and care coordination, the HHS’ guidance states disclosures of PHI between Covered Entities must be kept to the minimum necessary amount.  \n",
      "The term “continuity of care” has various definitions. Some definitions imply care is continuous within the same healthcare organization (or Organized Health Care Arrangement), while others extend the definition to multiple healthcare settings. An example of this is a patient’s journey from a physician’s office to a hospital, then to a care home, then to a home health service.\n",
      "With regards to HIPAA and continuity of care in a single healthcare setting – or within an Organized Health Care Arrangement – the Privacy Rule allows disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI) for healthcare operations without patient consent or authorization. One of the permissible disclosures of PHI in this category is for “case management and care coordination”.\n",
      "However, when continuity of care involves multiple providers in a linear process, some transfers of information can be incomplete due to the complicated language of the Privacy Rule and seemingly conflicting guidance issued by HHS’ Office for Civil Rights in 2019 with regard to HIPAA care coordination and HIPAA continuity of care.\n",
      "Continuation of Care, HIPAA, and What the Privacy Rule Says\n",
      "In the context of continuation of care, HIPAA §164.506(c)(4) states a Covered Entity may disclose PHI to another Covered Entity for health care operations if either Covered Entity has or had a relationship with the individual who is the subject of the PHI being disclosed, if the PHI being disclosed pertains to such relationship, and if it is for a purpose allowed by the definition of health care operations.\n",
      "The Privacy Rule (HIPAA §164.502(b)(2)) also states the minimum necessary standard does not apply to disclosures to or requests by a health care provider for treatment. Therefore, in the example given above of a patient’s journey from a physician’s office to a home health service, there should be no problem with the home health service obtaining PHI from the physician to provide treatment.\n",
      "However, in guidance issued by HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, several examples are given in which it is permissible to transfer PHI between Covered Entities to support care coordination and continuity of care under HIPAA. However, the HHS guidance concludes with a reminder that “although such disclosures are permitted, they are subject to the minimum necessary standard”.\n",
      "Office for Civil Rights Guidance for HIPAA Coordination of Care\n",
      "The conclusion to the guidance can appear to contradict the Privacy Rule – particularly the clause stating the minimum necessary standard does not apply to disclosures for treatment. However, when the examples in the guidance are more closely examined, they relate to disclosures of PHI between health plans – rather than healthcare providers – which are not for treatment purposes.\n",
      "Nonetheless, because the term Covered Entity is used in the guidance, some providers have applied the guidance to their healthcare operations and only provide the minimum necessary PHI to the next provider “up the continuity line”.  Provider B then has an incomplete medical history to transfer to Provider C, who also limits disclosures to the minimum necessary when handing off to Provider D.\n",
      "Provider D (in our example, the home health service) can acquire the PHI they need from Provider A (the physician) to ensure continuity of care under HIPAA; but, because Provider A believes they have to obtain an authorization from the patient before disclosing more than the minimum necessary PHI, there is an avoidable delay in Provider D receiving potentially vital healthcare data – which can impact patient care.\n",
      "Proposed Changes to Clarify HIPAA Care Coordination Rules\n",
      "To clarify the position between HIPAA and care coordination, several Rule changes have been proposed. The proposed changes – if finalized – will not only impact HIPAA compliance, but other federal Rules that govern uses and disclosures of PHI (i.e., 42 CFR Part 2). The key Notices of Proposed Rule Making (NPRMs) that will clarify the care coordination HIPAA rules are:\n",
      "The Office of Civil Rights’ Proposed Modifications to the Privacy Rule\n",
      "This NPRM published in January 2021 proposes multiple HIPAA updates to “support, and remove barriers to, coordinated care and individual engagement”. Among the proposed changes to the Privacy Rule:\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclosures of PHI will be permitted without the need to obtain consent or authorization to help individuals with a substance use disorder in emergency circumstances.\n",
      "Disclosures of PHI for continuity of care and individual-level care coordination will be specifically permitted to avoid misunderstanding about when consent is required.\n",
      "An exception to the Minimum Necessary Standard will be created for disclosures of PHI relating to individual-level HIPAA care coordination and case management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update to CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule\n",
      "In 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule. As the title suggests, the Rule has the primary objectives of improving interoperability between Medicare Covered Entities and enabling better patient access to PHI. Among other measures, a proposed update to the Rule published in December 2022 seeks stakeholder comments on how best to enable data exchanges via a Trusted Exchange Framework.\n",
      "Closer Alignment of 42 CFR Part 2 and  the HIPAA Privacy Rule\n",
      "Also at the end of 2022, the Office for Civil Rights and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) jointly published an NPRM that more closely aligns the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records (42 CFR Part 2) with the uses and disclosures of PHI permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. If finalized in its current format, the NPRM will better support compliance with HIPAA and care coordination for SUD and mental health patients.\n",

      "Maxim HealthCare Services Proposes Settlement to Resolve Email Breach Lawsuit\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 12, 2023\n",
      "A settlement has been proposed by Maxim HealthCare Services to resolve all claims related to a 2020 cyberattack and data breach involving unauthorized access to multiple employee email accounts. The email accounts were compromised between October 1, 2020, and December 4, 2020, but the unauthorized access was not discovered until November 2021.\n",
      "The review of the email accounts confirmed they contained protected health information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, provider names, medical histories, medical conditions, treatment information, medical record numbers, diagnosis codes, patient account numbers, Medicare/Medicaid numbers, usernames/passwords, and some Social Security numbers. The breach was reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights as affecting 65,267 patients.\n",
      "A lawsuit – Wilson, et al. v. Maxim Healthcare Services Inc. – was filed in response to the data breach in the Superior Court of the State of California County of San Diego that alleged Maxim HealthCare Services failed to implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to patient data. Maxim HealthCare Services chose to settle the lawsuit to avoid further legal costs and the uncertainty of trial. Maxim HealthCare Services denies all claims made in the lawsuit and maintains there was no wrongdoing. The proposed settlement applies to all individuals who were notified that they had been affected by the breach and had their protected health information exposed.\n",
      "Under the terms of the settlement, claims will be accepted up to a maximum of $5,000 for each class member for reimbursement of extraordinary expenses incurred as a result of the data breach, including up to three hours of lost time at $20 per hour. Individuals who were California Residents between October 1, 2020, and December 4, 2020, are entitled to receive a flat monetary benefit of approximately $100 which can be combined with claims for reimbursement of extraordinary expenses. All class members will be entitled to receive 12 months of free identity theft protection services, regardless of whether they submit a claim.\n",
      "The deadline for exclusion from and objection to the proposed settlement is June 23, 2023. The deadline for submitting claims is July 24, 2023. The final approval hearing has been scheduled for July 28, 2023. Maxim HealthCare Services has implemented or will implement additional security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n",

      "SuperCare Proposes $2.25 Million Settlement to Resolve Data Breach Lawsuit\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 11, 2023\n",
      "The Californian home care service provider, SuperCare, has proposed a $2.25 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit filed in response to a 2021 hacking incident in which the protected health information of 318,379 patients was compromised.\n",
      "SuperCare detected a network intrusion on July 27, 2021, and the subsequent forensic investigation determined hackers had access to its network from July 23, 2021, to July 27, 2021; however, it took until February 4, 2022, to determine that patient information had been compromised. Files on the compromised parts of the network contained names, addresses, dates of birth, hospital or medical group, patient account numbers, medical record numbers, health insurance information, test results, diagnoses, treatment information, other health-related information, and claims information, and, for some individuals, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. Affected individuals were notified on March 25, 2022, 8 months after the breach was detected.\n",
      "A lawsuit was filed against SuperCare shortly after the data breach was announced that accused SuperCare of violations of California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) due to the failure to implement reasonable and appropriate cybersecurity measures to protect against a known risk of cyberattacks and data breaches, and the failure to issue timely notifications about the data breach. Further, when notifications were finally sent, the content of those notifications was lacking key information about the data breach, and no explanation was provided as to why it took so long for the notifications to be issued. The lawsuit also claimed affected individuals were not provided with adequate credit monitoring services or other remedies to reduce the risk of misuse of their sensitive data.\n",
      "Under the terms of the proposed settlement, two tiers of benefits are being offered. Claims can be submitted for tier 1 benefits which include a cash payment of $100. The second tier allows claims up to a maximum of $2,500 to cover out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the data breach, along with up to 4 hours of lost time at $25 per hour. All class members are entitled to claim one year of three-bureau credit monitoring services, which includes a $1 million identity theft insurance policy.\n",
      "The deadline for exclusion from or objection to the settlement is June 5, 2023. Claims must be submitted by July 5, 2023, and the final approval hearing for the settlement has been scheduled for August 28, 2023.\n",

      "HIPAA Compliance for Dermatologists\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 11, 2023\n",
      "A number of sources discussing HIPAA compliance for dermatologists suggest all dermatologists are required to comply with HIPAA because they have access to personal health information. This is not correct, and it may be the case that some dermatologists have implemented HIPAA privacy and security safeguards unnecessarily.\n",
      "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is an Act passed in 1996 with the primary objectives of increasing individual access to health insurance, enabling individuals to continue health coverage between jobs, and limiting the restrictions health insurance plans can place on individuals with preexisting health conditions.\n",
      "Because achieving these objectives would incur costs for health plans – and because of concerns the costs would be passed on in the form of higher insurance premiums – Congress added measures to HIPAA to lower costs for health insurance companies by reducing the opportunities for insurance fraud and increasing the efficiency of healthcare transactions.\n",
      "These measures led to the publication of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations – the first nationwide standards for healthcare transactions. The Regulations also include the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. These Rules aim to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information and ensure individuals are notified when data breaches occur.\n",
      "Are Dermatologists Required to Comply with HIPAA?\n",
      "Persons and organizations required to comply with the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations are referred to as Covered Entities or Business Associates. In the healthcare industry, Covered Entities are persons or organizations that transmit health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which a standard has been adopted.\n",
      "The transactions for which a standard has been adopted can be found in Part 162 of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations. For dermatologists, the transactions generally relate to eligibility checks, authorizations, and billing health plans. If you – as an individual practitioner or practice – do not conduct these transactions, you do not qualify as a Covered Entity.\n",
      "However, if you provide dermatology services for or on behalf of a Covered Entity that involves the disclosure of Protected Health Information, you are classified as a Business Associate. Business Associates are subject to partial compliance inasmuch as they must comply with the Security and Breach Notification Rules, and any Privacy standards included in a Business Associate Agreement.\n",
      "Employees of dermatology practices are not classified as Covered Entities or Business Associates. Instead, employees are required to comply with the policies and procedures implemented by their employer to comply with HIPAA. However, it is important to be aware that, if HIPAA does not apply to a dermatology practice, other state privacy, security, and breach notification regulations may.\n",
      "What HIPAA Compliance for Dermatologists Consists Of\n",
      "What HIPAA compliance for dermatologists consists of depends on the practice`s HIPAA “status”. A practice, clinic, laser treatment center, or medspa qualifies as a Covered Entity even if only one transaction is governed by the standards in Part 162. In such cases, it will be necessary to comply with all applicable standards in the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.\n",
      "This means developing and enforcing policies and procedures to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information, distributing a Notice of Privacy Practices, implementing measures to comply with the Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguards of the Security Rule, and having procedures in place to alert individuals and HHS’ Office for Civil Rights in the event of a data breach.\n",
      "It will be necessary to train all members of the workforce (not just employees) on the policies and procedures, provide online security and awareness training, and enforce a sanctions policy for members of the workforce that do not comply with the practice’s policies and procedures. It will also be necessary to designate a Privacy Officer to oversee compliance and a HIPAA Security Officer.\n",
      "If the practice qualifies as a Business Associate, it will be necessary to implement all applicable standards in the Security and Breach Notification Rules, plus any Privacy standards stipulated by the Covered Entity for whom a service is provided for or on behalf of. It will also be necessary to provide online security and awareness training, enforce a sanctions policy, and designate a Security Officer.\n",
      "Further Information about HIPAA Compliance for Dermatologists\n",
      "If you operate as a dermatology practitioner – or you run a dermatology practice, clinic, laser treatment center, or medspa – and you are unsure about either your HIPAA status or your HIPAA compliance obligations, you should seek professional compliance advice. Failing to understand HIPAA compliance for dermatologists is not a justifiable defense in the event of a HIPAA violation or data breach that results in civil action by HHS’ Office for Civil Rights or a State Attorney General.\n",

      "Is SurveyMonkey HIPAA Compliant?\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 10, 2023\n",
      "Is SurveyMonkey HIPAA compliant? At the present time, SurveyMonkey is HIPAA compliant. However, SurveyMonkey’s parent company – Momentive – is in the process of being acquired by a private equity consortium. If the acquisition proceeds, we cannot guarantee the information below will remain accurate.\n",
      "SurveyMonkey is an online application that enables subscribers to create and send surveys via email, social media, and messaging services. The application is most often used in the healthcare industry to gain insights into patients’ health habits, track the effectiveness of patient safety programs, and solicit feedback from members of the workforce.\n",
      "Although SurveyMonkey offers a free plan, it is extremely limited. Free subscribers can only ask up to 10 questions per survey, plus accept only 40 responses per survey. Additionally, if PHI is going to be disclosed in any answers or questions, it will be necessary to enter into a Business Associate Agreement – something SurveyMonkey is only prepared to do with subscribers to its business plans.\n",
      "Is SurveyMonkey HIPAA Compliant?\n",
      "In its role as a Business Associate, SurveyMonkey is HIPAA compliant. The company provides a comprehensive security statement and a HIPAA compliance web page on which it attests to reasonably and appropriately protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI received, maintained, or transmitted on behalf of Covered Entities (subject to accounts being HIPAA-enabled). The web page also lists some of the safeguards SurveyMonkey has put in place:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assigned security team responsible for maintaining compliance with HIPAA.\n",
      "Screening, authorization, and HIPAA training of SurveyMonkey staff.\n",
      "Data backup and disaster recovery plans.\n",
      "Systems regularly monitored, updated, and patched.\n",
      "Incident response plan that includes reporting security incidents to Covered Entities.\n",
      "All communications with SurveyMonkey servers are encrypted with SSL.\n",
      "Regular risk assessments to ensure safeguards remain relevant and effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regards to the Business Associate Agreement, SurveyMonkey offers its own Agreement or will enter a Covered Enty’s Agreement subject to being able to comply with the terms of the Agreement. Helpfully, the company has published a preview BAA on its website. However, visitors are alerted to the fact that the preview BAA was last updated in 2015 and reminded that SurveyMonkey’s parent company may soon be acquired – so the terms of the preview BAA may not remain the same.\n",
      "Complying with HIPAA when using SurveyMonkey\n",
      "If a Business Associate Agreement is in place, SurveyMonkey has the tools to support HIPAA compliance. These tools include activity logs and optional automatic log-off – which administrators should configure to comply with organizational HIPAA policies – and alert messages that warn users when they risk disclosing PHI or risk respondents disclosing PHI.\n",
      "However, alert messages can be ignored and mistakes made. Therefore, it is important to train users on the compliant use of SurveyMonkey and how to respond if a response to a survey question discloses PHI they are not authorized to see. It may also be necessary to train users on how to identify and report inadvertent data breaches to compliance officers.\n",
      "In conclusion, although SurveyMonkey is HIPAA compliant in its role as a Business Associate and has the tools to support HIPAA compliance, it is the responsibility of each Covered Entity to subscribe to an appropriate HIPAA-enabled business plan, configure the tools correctly, ensure users are trained how to comply with HIPAA when using SurveyMonkey, and monitor compliance.\n",

      "University Urology in New York City has started notifying 56,816 individuals that unauthorized individuals gained access to some of its systems and potentially obtained their personal and health information. Suspicious activity was detected within its computer systems on February 1, 2023, and third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to conduct a forensic analysis of the incident to determine the nature and scope of the attack. The investigation concluded on March 3, 2023, that files within its network were accessed. A manual review of those files was conducted and concluded on March 30, 2023. Contact information was then verified, and notification letters were sent on May 1, 2023.\n",
      "The types of information that were exposed varied from individual to individual and may have included first and last name, date of birth, address, medical condition, medical treatment, test results, prescription information, health insurance information, subscriber ID number, health plan beneficiary number, billing/invoice information, and username/email address plus passwords/security questions and answers that would allow account access.\n",
      "University Urology said Sentinel One agents were deployed for 30 days, which allowed the cybersecurity firm to monitor its environment for malicious activity and indicators of compromise. It has now been confirmed that all methods of persistence, unauthorized remote access tools, and malicious files have been removed from its systems, and additional security measures have now been implemented.\n",
      "While there have been no reported cases of actual or attempted misuse of the exposed data, complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to affected individuals for 12 or 24 months.\n",

The internal investigation concluded on March 15, 2023, that patient data may have been acquired, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical treatment information, billing information, and health insurance information. Notification letters were sent in early May, almost 10 months after the attack.\n",

      "Catholic Health – Unauthorized Access by Employee of Business Associate\n",
      "Catholic Health in New York has recently announced that the protected health information of some of its long-term care residents has been exposed in a security breach at one of its business associates, Minimum Data Set Consultants (MDS). MDS launched an investigation into a potential data breach in March 2023 after discovering suspicious system activity.\n",
      "The investigation confirmed that an unauthorized individual accessed patient data on or around August 27, 2022, such as names, birthdates, Social Security and Medicare numbers, and diagnosis information. The unauthorized access was traced to a former employee. MDS has confirmed that that individual no longer has access to the system and that the matter has been reported to law enforcement, which has launched an investigation. While patient data is not believed to have been accessed with a view to committing identity theft or fraud, affected individuals have been told to monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\n",
      "The breach has been reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights as affecting 12,759 individuals.\n",

      "University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics Sued for Unlawful Disclosures of PHI to Facebook\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 10, 2023\n",
      "A lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa that alleges University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) unlawfully, negligently, and recklessly disclosed patients’ private information to Facebook, without obtaining patient consent.\n",
      "HIPAA_regulated entities are facing increased scrutiny of their website practices following the discovery of widespread use of website tracking code, often referred to as pixels, for monitoring website visitor activity. The snippets of code record information about website and app activity that is tied to individual users. The information gathered can be used to improve the user experience, but the information collected is often transferred to the providers of the code. A study that was recently published in Health Affairs found 98.6% of nonfederal acute care hospital websites in the United States had tracking pixels on their websites, which collected and transferred sensitive data to Meta (Facebook), Google, and other third parties. The information transmitted could be used for a variety of purposes, such as serving targeted advertisements based on specific medical conditions researched or disclosed on healthcare providers’ websites.\n",
      "The extent to which patient privacy was being violated prompted the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights to issue guidance in 2022 on the use of website tracking code, and this year OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer confirmed that these unauthorized disclosures of PHI are now an enforcement priority for OCR. Lawyers have also been quick to take action, with more than 50 lawsuits already filed against healthcare entities over the use of these tracking tools.\n",
      "The UIHC lawsuit – Yeisley v. University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics – was filed on behalf of plaintiff Eileen Yeisley and similarly situated individuals. The lawsuit claims UIHC manages or controls two websites that are used for booking appointments, locating treatment facilities and physicians, and registering patients for events and classes. The lawsuit alleges UIHC intentionally included a Facebook pixel on both of those websites that shared visitor activity with Facebook and linked that information to individuals’ personal Facebook accounts. The lawsuit also alleges UIHC installed a Facebook conversion application programming interface (API) on the websites, which works independently of the pixel and allows additional disclosures of protected health information (PHI) to Facebook.\n",
      "The use of these code snippets results in the sensitive data of patients and prospective patients being sent to Facebook without their consent or knowledge and that information can then be sold by Facebook to third parties to allow individuals to be targeted with advertisements specific to medical conditions disclosed or researched on the websites. The lawsuit claims that the code was added by UIHC to boost profits and includes evidence – screenshots – that shows the source code of UIHC websites includes the Facebook code snippets.\n",
      "OCR confirmed in its guidance that these disclosures of PHI are generally not permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and warrant notifications under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule. Several healthcare providers have reported breaches of PHI due to tracking code to OCR, but UIHC has yet to issue breach notifications. University of Iowa Health has issued a statement in response to the allegations, “University of Iowa Health Care is committed to protecting patient privacy. We do not share protected health information of our patients with Meta or Facebook. We will review the lawsuit once received.”\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges negligence, invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment breach of confidence, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and seeks class action status, equitable and injunctive relief, and an order from the court to prevent UIHC from engaging in this activity in the future. The lawsuit also seeks an award of damages, including actual, consequential, punitive, and nominal damages.\n",

      "Federal Court Dismisses FTC Complaint Against Kochava\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 9, 2023\n",
      "A complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the mobile app attribution and analytics company, Kochava, has been dismissed by a federal judge, although the door has been left open for a revised complaint that makes stronger arguments that the actions of Kochava have caused harms to consumers.\n",
      "The FTC’s lawsuit against Kochava, filed in August 2022, alleged the company was selling the geolocation data of consumers gathered from their mobile phones without their knowledge. The geolocation data is tied to each individual user by a unique ID associated with their device. The FTC argued that the geolocation data could be used to identify individuals who had visited sensitive locations such as abortion clinics, mental health treatment centers, places of worship, and other sensitive locations. For example, the data sold by Kochava could be used to identify women who traveled from an anti-abortion state to a state where abortion is illegal, allowing those women to be prosecuted as well as the individuals that helped them have an out-of-state abortion. The FTC lawsuit alleged Kochava had engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices, in violation of the FTC Act. Kochava was aware that a lawsuit would likely be filed by the FTC and attempted to preempt it by filing its own lawsuit then sought to have the FTC lawsuit dismissed. Those efforts have been partially successful.\n",
      "At this early stage of the litigation, the question that needed to be answered by the court was whether the FTC had stated a plausible claim against Kochava. Idaho District Judge B. Lynn Winmill said in his ruling that the privacy concerns raised by the FTC in the complaint were certainly legitimate and that the FTC’s theory that consumers could suffer an injury as a result of the sale of their data was certainly plausible. Judge Winmill agreed that individuals would be at risk of secondary harms but said the FTC failed to point to any specific examples of harms that have been caused, only stating a risk of secondary harms. The FTC failed to attach any degree of probability to the risks. While there is certainly a risk that geolocation data could be used to target individuals, the mere possibility of injury is not sufficient to allow the lawsuit to proceed.\n",
      "The FTC argued that the invasion of privacy alone constitutes an injury, and while that is true, in this case, the privacy violation was not determined to be sufficiently severe to meet the threshold for injury. Specifically, because Kochava has not been accused of selling or disclosing private information, only selling data from which private information may be inferred from the presence of an individual in or near a sensitive location. The geolocation data does not indicate an individual has received a specific service or visited a location for a specific purpose and inferences are often unreliable. Further, location information could be obtained through legal means, such as observing a person visiting a sensitive location and then obtaining the individual’s address from public records. Finally, the FTC’s lawsuit would need to state, at least approximately, how many individuals could suffer privacy violations as a result of the sale of the data by Kochava. The FTC failed to state how many people are likely to be injured.\n",
      "While the complaint was dismissed, Judge Winmill agreed that consumers have no reasonable way of avoiding potential harms that are caused as a result of Kochava’s business practices and that any benefits that come from the sale of the data do not outweigh the harms that can be caused. The FTC has been given a further 30 days to refile the lawsuit with strengthened arguments that the privacy violations will likely cause substantial injury to consumers.\n",

      "NextGen Healthcare Reports Breach Affecting More than 1 Million Patients\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 9, 2023\n",
      "NextGen Healthcare has started notifying more than 1 million individuals across the United States about a hacking incident that exposed their protected health information. NextGen Healthcare is an Atlanta, GA-based provider of electronic health records and practice management solutions to doctors and ambulatory care providers. On March 30, 2023, suspicious activity was detected in its NextGen Office system and third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the nature and scope of the security breach. The investigation revealed unauthorized individuals had access to the system between March 29, 2023, and April 14, 2023.\n",
      "NextGen said unauthorized individuals had access to “a limited dataset” during that period, which included protected health information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. No evidence was found to indicate the attackers accessed patient medical records or any health or medical data and there have been no reports of any actual or attempted misuse of patient data. Passwords were reset when the breach was discovered, and additional security measures have now been implemented to strengthen security. Notification letters have already started to be sent to affected individuals, who have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 24 months.\n",
      "The data breach has yet to appear on the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights breach portal, but is showing on the websites of several state Attorneys General. The breach notification issued to the Maine Attorney General indicates 1,049,375 individuals were affected in total, including 3,913 Maine residents. The breach was reported to the Texas Attorney General as involving the PHI of 131,815 Texas residents.\n",
      "This is the second cyberattack to affect NextGen Healthcare in recent months. In January 2023, NextGen was added to the data leak site of the BlackCat ransomware group, although the listing was later taken down. The incident was investigated and a spokesman for NextGen said no patient data had been exposed or downloaded, and consequently this was not a reportable data breach.\n",

      "The BianLian and RansomHouse ransomware groups have recently added Albany ENT and Allergy Services to their data leak sites, with the latter claiming to have stolen 1 TB of data before encrypting files. According to the listings, files were encrypted on March 27, 2023; however, Albany ENT and Allergy Services has yet to announce a cyberattack on its website. The dual listings suggest that both groups have conducted an attack; although only RansomHouse has posed evidence on its data leak site to back up its claims.\n",

      "Pittsburgh Counselor Fined $15,000 for HIPAA Right of Access Violation\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 9, 2023\n",
      "The HHS’ Office for Civil Rights has announced its 44th enforcement action under its HIPAA Right of Access initiative with a $15,000 financial penalty for David Mente, MA, LPC, a licensed counselor that provides psychotherapy services in Pittsburgh, PA.\n",
      "The HIPAA Right of Access allows individuals to obtain a copy of their health information. Healthcare providers are required to respond to requests and provide the requested records within 30 days of the request being received, although a 30-day extension is possible in certain circumstances. This case stemmed from a complaint from a father of three children who requested a copy of his minor children’s medical records from Mente in December 2017. The complainant was the personal representative of his children and should have been provided with the records as requested.\n",
      "After receiving the complaint, OCR contacted Mente, provided technical assistance on the HIPAA Right of Access, and closed the complaint. The father made a second request for a copy of the records in April 2018; however, Mente again failed to provide the requested records, despite having received technical assistance from OCR. That led to the father filing a second complaint with OCR.\n",
      "OCR reopened the case and determined that the failure to provide the requested records was a potential violation of the HIPAA Right of Access. Mente chose not to contest the proposed penalty and settled the case with OCR.  In addition to the financial penalty, Mente agreed to adopt a corrective action plan to address the noncompliance. The corrective action plan includes the requirement to review and revise policies and procedures for individual access to PHI, to provide privacy training to the workforce on individual access to individuals’ PHI, and to make a good faith effort to provide the complainant with the requested records or to deny access, in whole or in part, consistent with 45 C.F.R. 164.524(3).\n",
      "This is the third financial penalty to be imposed by OCR in 2023 to resolve potential violations of the HIPAA Rules and follows on from a $1,250,000 settlement with Banner Health and a $16,500 settlement with Life Hope Labs LLC.\n",
      "“Under HIPAA, parents, as the personal representatives of their minor children, generally have a right to access their children’s medical records,” said OCR Director Melanie Fontes Rainer. “It should not take an individual or their parent representative nearly six years and multiple complaints to gain access to patient records.  HIPAA-regulated entities should be proactive and work to ensure patients and their representatives can access records.”\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 8, 2023\n",
      "NationsBenefits Holdings, LLC, a provider of supplemental benefits, flex cards, and member engagement solutions to health plans and managed care organizations, has confirmed that it has been affected by a security breach involving Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT file transfer solution. The hackers behind the attack – the Clop ransomware group – gained access to NationsBenefits data on January 30, 2023, and exfiltrated that information from the GoAnywhere MFT solution. A ransom demand was issued, payment of which was required to prevent the publication of the stolen data. NationsBenefits was on of 130 organizations to have data stolen in the attacks.\n",
      "The Clop group exploited a previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerability in the GoAnywhere MFT solution, which allowed them to access and steal data from vulnerable on-premises MFT servers. NationsBenefits Holdings said the Clop group was only able to access two MFT servers; however, a review of the files on those servers revealed they contained the protected health information of 3,037,303 health plan members, including, but not limited to, Aetna ACE, Elevance Health Flexible Benefit Plan, and UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. The compromised information included: first and last name, address, phone number, date of birth, gender, health plan subscriber ID number, Social Security number, and/or Medicare number.\n",
      "Other healthcare organizations known to have been affected include Community Health Systems (1 million individuals) and Brightline (at least 964,300 individuals); however, NationsBenefits is currently the worst affected healthcare entity. Overall, more than 4 million individuals had their protected health information stolen in these attacks. NationsBenefits said it learned about the security breach when its security monitoring team received an alert from one of its MFT servers at 16:02 on February 7, 2023, indicating unauthorized access. Fortra was contacted and asked to assist with the investigation, with the initial review confirming that the MFT server had been accessed and data had been stolen. The subsequent internal investigation confirmed that the threat actor did not move laterally to other NationsBenefits systems or applications.\n",
      "NationsBenefits confirmed that prior to the attack layered security controls were already in place, but said security measures have since been strengthened. NationsBenefits has taken its MFT servers permanently offline and has transitioned to an alternative file transfer solution that does not rely on Fortra software. Notification letters started to be mailed to affected individuals on April 13, 2023. Complimentary credit monitoring services have been offered for 24 months.\n",

      "Brightline: At Least 964,300 Individuals Affected by Fortra GoAnywhere Hack\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 8, 2023\n",
      "Brightline, a provider of virtual behavioral and mental services to families, has confirmed it was affected by the cyberattack on Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT file transfer solution, which saw a zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks on 130 organizations over a 10-day period starting on January 18, 2023. While the Clop threat group conducts ransomware attacks, ransomware was not used in these attacks. Like the attacks that exploited a vulnerability in the Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) in 2021, the group opted for data theft and extortion with no file encryption.\n",
      "Brightline explained in its website breach notification that the attack occurred on January 30, 2023, and said Fortra’s investigation confirmed that files had been downloaded that contained protected health information. Brightline was notified about the attack by Fortra on February 4, 2023. Brightline’s internal investigation confirmed that the attack was limited to data within the GoAnywhere solution and that its systems had not been compromised. After determining the extent of the breach and the individuals affected, Brightline started notifying the affected HIPAA-Covered Entities. The breach involved names, addresses, dates of birth, member identification numbers, date of health plan coverage, and/or employer names. Affected individuals have been offered 24 months of complimentary credit monitoring services.\n",
      "In response to the breach, Brightline deactivated the unauthorized user’s credentials used to access its data, turned off the GoAnywhere service, and rebuilt it with the zero-day vulnerability addressed. Additional data security measures were also implemented, including limiting access to verified users, removing all data in the service, and taking steps to reduce data exposure until an alternative file transfer solution can be implemented.  Affected individuals were notified starting on April 7, 2023, and notifications were issued on behalf of some affected Covered Entities. Brightline was listed on the Clop data leak site on March 16, 2023, although has since been removed. While this typically only occurs when a ransom is paid, a member of the Clop group emailed Bleeping Computer to say that Brightline’s data were deleted as the group was unaware of the nature of the business conducted by Brightline and said, “We ask for forgiveness for this incident,” which suggests no ransom was paid.\n",
      "Brightline has published a list of 58 HIPAA-Covered Entities that were affected by the data breach and has – at the time of writing – submitted 9 data breach notifications to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights. Those notifications indicate 964,300 individuals have been affected. Those notifications indicate between 4,044 and 462,241 individuals were affected. It is unclear to what extent the notifications cover the 58 affected Covered Entities. If a separate breach notification has been issued for each affected Covered Entity, 49 of the affected Covered Entities may be issuing their own notifications, which would likely take the total number of affected individuals well past 1,000,000. Some of the notifications issued to state attorneys general by the affected clients state that Brightline issued multiple requests to Fortra asking for it to issue notifications to affected individuals and regulators, but Fortra refused.\n",

      "Ransomware Attack Results in 2 Week Shutdown of Operations at TN Medical Clinic\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 7, 2023\n",
      "A cyberattack on Murfreesboro Medical Clinic & SurgiCenter (MMC) in Tennessee forced the healthcare provider to completely shut down operations for around two weeks to contain to attack and restore its IT systems. It is common for healthcare organizations to perform an emergency shutdown of the network to contain a cyberattack and limit the harm caused, and to operate under emergency procedures with staff recording patient information manually while systems are out of action. Some attacks see ambulances diverted and some appointments canceled for patient safety reasons, but the disruption caused by this attack was much more extensive.\n",
      "The cyberattack occurred on April 22, 2023, and the network was rapidly shut down to contain the attack. Third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to assist with the investigation and recovery from the attack. MMC said the rapid action taken in response to the security breach limited the damage caused, and work has continued round the clock to safely bring systems back online and enhance security controls. MMC has been working with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to investigate the incident and determine the extent of the attack, and while those processes were completed, the decision was taken to close all operations. MMC planned to reopen on a limited basis on May 3, 2023, then restore full operations shortly thereafter; however, the recovery process took longer than planned.\n",
      "The MMC Pediatric and Internal & Family Walk-In Clinics at its Garrison Drive location reopened on May 4, 2023, but all other locations remained closed. On May 5, 2023, all surgeries in its SurgiCenter, Gastroenterology procedures, Laboratory and Radiology services were canceled, MMC Now locations remained closed, although phone lines were restored. Over the weekend of May 6th and 7th, MMC Pediatrics resumed normal weekend operations, but MMC Now Family Walk-In Clinics and Laboratory and Radiology services remained closed for the weekend. On Monday, May 8, 2023, operations remained limited, although some scheduled appointments went ahead as planned, although laboratory and radiology services and MMC Now Family Walk-In locations remained closed.\n",
      "“Preserving sensitive patient and employee information is of the utmost importance to MMC, but like so many other organizations around the country and despite its best efforts, MMC has found itself as the target of criminals attempting to steal personal or company data. I want to thank our patients and employees for their understanding and patience while we work to make sure our computer infrastructure is secure and free of any harmful software,” said Joey Peay, CEO of MMC. “We have worked diligently to communicate closures with all patients in a timely manner using all methods of communication at our disposal… we apologize for the vagueness of our recent communications, but we did not want to do anything that would impede law enforcement’s investigative efforts.”\n",
      "While the exact nature of the cyberattack has not been disclosed, this is understood to be a ransomware attack involving data theft. The extent to which patient data has been affected is being investigated and MMC will make further announcements and issue notifications as necessary when the investigation concludes.\n",

If exploited, a malicious actor could use UCS to listen on all IP addresses, including those capable of accepting remove communications, remotely take control of the affected devices, change device settings, and alter or steal sensitive data. The flaw can be exploited remotely with low attack complexity and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10 out of 10.\n",
      "The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-1966, affects UCS v1.x and v2.0 and is due to unnecessary privileges. A remote attacker could upload and execute code remotely at the operating system level, allowing changes to be made to settings and configurations and sensitive data to be accessed on the affected products. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.4 out of 10.\n",
      "The vulnerabilities were discovered by Illumina and were reported to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA). Illumina says it is unaware of any instances of actual or attempted exploitation of the flaws; however, due to the severity of the vulnerabilities and the ease of exploitation, immediate patching is recommended.\n",
      "On April 5, 2023, Illumina notified customers about the flaw requesting they check for signs of exploitation. A patch has now been released along with a Vulnerability Instructions Guide to help users address the flaw based on the specific configurations of their devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued a warning to healthcare providers and laboratory personnel that the vulnerabilities may present risks for patient results and customer networks. Until the patch can be applied, steps should be taken to reduce the risk of exploitation, including minimizing network exposure, ensuring the affected devices are not accessible over the Internet, locating control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and only using secure methods to remotely access the devices, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n",

      "Compliancy Group has recently assessed Lez Van De Mortel LLC and determined that the company has implemented an effective HIPAA compliance program and is fully compliant with the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Omnibus Rules, and has achieved compliance with the regulatory standards of the HITECH Act.\n",
      "Lez Van De Mortel is a CHPSE-certified HIPAA compliance expert that specializes in building HIPAA-compliant patient acquisition systems for healthcare organizations interested in serious growth. Turnkey marketing engines are developed that leverage all popular online advertising platforms that are fully compliant with the HIPAA Rules and all federal and state regulations.\n",
      "Since the solutions developed by Lez Van De Mortel come into contact with protected health information, Lez Van De Mortel is classed as a business associate under HIPAA and is required to be fully compliant with the HIPAA Rules. The vast majority of digital marketing agencies do not offer HIPAA-compliant marketing solutions for HIPAA-covered entities. Using a digital marketing company that is not compliant with the HIPAA Rules puts healthcare organizations at risk of civil monetary penalties, and the Director of the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights has recently confirmed that disclosures of PHI to social media platforms are now an enforcement priority for OCR.\n",
      "Lez Van De Mortel enters into business associate agreements with healthcare clients, but for total peace of mind, Lez Van De Mortel partnered with Compliancy Group and used the company’s proven HIPAA methodology to confirm compliance with all appropriate provisions and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Rules. That process includes a 6-stage risk analysis and risk management process, with progress tracked using Compliancy Group’s proprietary HIPAA compliance tracking software – The Guard.

      "Passwordless Authentication Adoption Increases but Poor Password Practices Persist\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 4, 2023\n",
      "A recent survey of IT decision makers has provided insights on password management practices and has confirmed the increasing adoption of passwordless authentication. This is the third year that the password manager provider, Bitwarden, has conducted its Password Decisions Survey, which this year was conducted by Propeller Insights on 400 America IT decision makers and 2,000 Internet users and revealed their password habits, and attitudes to password security and passwordless authentication technologies.\n",
      "The survey confirmed that little has changed over the past 12 months, with poor password practices proving difficult to eliminate. Password manager use declined slightly year-over-year, with 84% of IT decision makers saying they use password management software at work, down from 84% in 2022, but up from 77% in 2021. The slight decline may be in part due to a significant data breach at LastPass in 2022. While the password manager was not breached, hackers gained access to an encrypted backup copy of the password vaults of an unspecified number of users.\n",
      "Despite this, password managers are still widely thought to improve password security and the survey indicates there is considerable demand from employees for password managers, with 79% of Internet users saying they would like their employer to provide one. While 84% of respondents said they use a password manager at work, poor password practices are still common, with 54% of respondents admitting to saving their passwords in a document on their computer (53% in 2022), 45% relying on memory for passwords (42% in 2022), and 29% writing their passwords down (unchanged). 22% of employees claim they have been reusing the same password for more than a decade.\n",
      "While 66% of IT decision makers said they share passwords securely via a password manager, a significant percentage use less secure methods such as email (41%), shared online documents (38%), chat and messaging apps (30%), verbal disclosures (27%), and written notes (22%). Worryingly, 90% of IT decision makers admitted to reusing passwords in the workplace, down slightly from 92% in 2022. Out of the respondents that do reuse passwords, the extent to which passwords are reused is reducing. 11% reuse passwords on 15+ sites (15% in 2022), 24% use the same password on 10-15 sites (27% in 2022), 36% reuse passwords on 5-10 sites (33% in 2022), and 19% use the same password on 1-5 sites (16% in 2022).\n",
      "2-factor authentication can significantly improve security and adoption is growing, with 92% of respondents saying they use it in the workplace, up from 88% in 2022. The most common reasons for not implementing 2-FA are believed to be a failure to understand the benefits, a belief that passwords alone provide good enough protection, account hacking is unlikely, and the negative effect the additional authentication on workflows.\n",
      "Despite the risks of using unauthorized software and hardware (shadow IT), 32% of IT decision makers admitted to using unauthorized devices and software as did 49% of employees. The majority of people who admitted to using shadow IT (73%) said they did so because it helps them work more efficiently. 52% said they still used unauthorized software or hardware when they were unable to get authorization to use it, and 50% just went ahead because of the slow response times for authorization from the IT department.\n",
      "The increasing cost of data breaches and the rate that they are occurring has prompted organizations to seek cyber insurance. 75% of surveyed IT decision makers said they have cyber insurance policies, but insurers are demanding proof of security measures before they agree to provide insurance policies. 65% of IT decision makers said they had to demonstrate they provided security awareness training to employees, had multifactor authentication (64%), used a password manager (61%), had an incident response plan (50%), had adequate data backup processes (48%), and demonstrate they were patching regularly (28%). Only 3% of organizations were not required to provide any proof that these measures were in place.\n",
      "Concern about password security and the number of password-related data breaches are driving the adoption of passwordless technology such as biometrics, passkeys, and security keys. 41% of respondents believe passwordless authentication provides better security, 24% say it improves the user experience, 17% say it reduces the burden on the IT department, and 19% believe it improves productivity. 57% of U.S. respondents said they were excited about passwordless technology, with 49% saying they have either deployed the technology or are planning to, although out of those that have started to adopt passwordless authentication, 87% have yet to roll it out across the entire organization. Out of the organizations that have adopted the technology, 51% use biometrics, facial recognition, fingerprint, or voiceprints, and 31% use a physical item such as a security key or FIDO auth.\n",
      "One of the major reasons for reluctance to use passwordless technology such as fingerprints, voice prints, and face IDs is fear that it would be used against them, which was a concern for 36% of respondents that have yet to adopt the technology. 55% of respondents said they prefer to rely on memory for passwords, even though people that rely on memory tend to create much weaker passwords. Remembering passwords also leads to productivity losses. 58% of respondents said they regularly have to reset their passwords because they have forgotten them, with 12% saying it is an everyday occurrence.\n",

      "Psychotherapy Notes and HIPAA\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 3, 2023\n",
      "The relationship between psychotherapy notes and HIPAA is more complex than with most other types of health information. This is because, under HIPAA, psychotherapy notes are considered to be Protected Health Information not usually required for treatment, payment, or health care operations other than by the healthcare professional who created them.\n",
      "Explaining what psychotherapy notes are under HIPAA is not straightforward because you have to combine multiple definitions in different areas of the Administrative Simplification Regulations to reach a conclusion. Certainly, psychotherapy notes qualify as individually identifiable health information under HIPAA as individually identifiable health information is (loosely) defined as:\n",
      "“Health information […] collected from an individual […] by a healthcare provider […] that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care […] that identifies the individual or […] can be used to identify the individual.”\n",
      "This definition qualifies psychotherapy notes as Protected Health Information and subject to the protections of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. However, to qualify as psychotherapy notes as defined by §164.501 of the Privacy Rule, the content of the notes must not include any information that would be included in the patient’s medical record.\n",
      "This means psychotherapy notes have to maintained in a separate designated record set from other Protected Health Information and cannot include any information about medication prescription and monitoring, counseling session start and stop times, the types and frequencies of treatment, or results of clinical tests. Additionally, psychotherapy notes cannot include summaries of diagnoses, functional statuses, treatment plans, symptoms, prognosis, and patients’ progress to date.\n",
      "What can be Included in Psychotherapy Notes under HIPAA?\n",
      "The content of psychotherapy notes under HIPAA is limited to records of conversations during private counseling sessions or a group, joint, or family counseling sessions. The notes have to be recorded by a registered mental health professional who is a Covered Entity, who is employed by a Covered Entity, or who is providing a service for or on behalf of a Covered Entity as a Business Associate.\n",
      "Because the notes are not usually required for treatment, payment, or health care operations other than by the healthcare professional who created them, they are subject to stricter conditions for uses and disclosures than other Protected Health Information. Generally, psychotherapy notes can only be disclosed with a patient’s authorization other than in a limited number of circumstances:\n",
      "\n",
      "When used for HIPAA training in which mental health trainees learn under supervision how to improve their counselling skills.\n",
      "When used by the mental health professional or Covered Entity to defend a legal action brought by the subject of the psychotherapy notes.\n",
      "When required by law – for example to comply with state-mandated “duty to warn” requirements or to report abuse.\n",
      "When disclosed to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (subject to additional conditions).\n",
      "When used by the healthcare professional who created the psychotherapy notes for treatment of the subject of the notes.\n",
      "For healthcare oversight purposes when the subject of the oversight is the originator of the psychotherapy notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychotherapy Notes and HIPAA: Summary\n",
      "According to HHS´ Breach Report, data breaches involving psychotherapy notes and HIPAA violations are not common. This may be because HHS only publishes details of data breaches in which more than 500 individuals have been affected. There could be many more smaller data breaches affecting fewer individuals, so it is difficult to determine whether the relationship between psychotherapy notes and HIPAA is challenging for mental health professionals.\n",
      "Nonetheless, it is important Covered Entities and Business Associates providing mental health services on behalf of a Covered Entity understand how HIPAA defines psychotherapy notes, how notes should be kept in separate designated record sets, and when they can be used or disclosed without a patient authorization. Covered Entities and Business Associates unsure about the relationship between psychotherapy notes and HIPAA should seek professional compliance advice.\n",

      "Patient No Longer Seeking Injunction to Force Healthcare Provider to Pay Ransom\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 3, 2023\n",
      "There has been an update to a lawsuit filed against Lehigh Valley Health Network over a ransomware attack that involved the theft of sensitive patient data and the publication of naked images of patients on the Internet.\n",
      "Lehigh Valley Health Network detected the ransomware attack on February 6, 2023, and was issued with a ransom demand. The BlackCat group threatened to release the stolen data online if the ransom was not paid. While it is common for ransomware gangs to steal sensitive data and publish files if the victim fails to cooperate, the BlackCat ransomware group took the extortion a step further and published naked images of patients to pressure Lehigh Valley Health Network into paying the ransom. The images in question were clinically appropriate for radiation oncology treatment and showed patients naked from the waist up. The ransomware group was seeking payment of approximately $5 million. Lehigh Valley Health Network chose not to pay the ransom.\n",
      "A lawsuit was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County in Pennsylvania, which alleged Lehigh Valley Health Network failed to adequately protect patient data and failed to meet its obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The lead plaintiff, Jane Doe, had her naked images posted by the group. She maintains that she was not aware that the photographs had been taken.\n",
      "The lawsuit sought class action status, a jury trial, and remedies including damages, reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs, and equitable and injunctive relief, including an order from the court compelling Lehigh Valley Health Network to improve its data security systems and provide identity theft protection services for the plaintiff and class.\n",
      "Court Order Sought to Force Lehigh Valley Health Network to Pay the Ransom\n",
      "One of those remedies sought by the plaintiff concerned the removal of her partially naked photographs from the Internet. Lehigh Valley Health Network no longer had control of those photographs, so the plaintiff sought a court order compelling Lehigh Valley Health Network to pay the ransom and obtain a pledge from the BlackCat group that the images would be removed from the Internet.\n",
      "The plaintiff’s legal team said the plaintiff is worried that she may be identified by the images, that they may be viewed by her employer or people at work, and that she would be constantly worried that the images would be discovered for as long as they were available online. The patient’s attorney claimed images stolen by the group had been published online and could be found by searching using the individuals’ names, and that this was a deeply upsetting violation of patient privacy. The move to compel Lehigh Valley Health Network to pay the ransom was the only way that the plaintiff’s legal team could get the images removed from the Internet. The request was unusual, but this was not a typical ransomware and extortion attempt.\n",
      "The request raised some important legal issues that U.S. District Court Judge, Judge Malachy E. Manion, moved to address. Judge Manion questioned the plaintiff’s legal team on the legality of the request and whether the court had the authority to force a defendant to commit a potentially illegal act. While U.S. law does generally not prohibit the payment of a ransom for the return of people or goods; however, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can impose sanctions on organizations that pay ransoms to cyber actors under its sanctions program.\n",
      "In response to the request, Judge Manion ordered the plaintiff’s attorneys to file a brief in support of their preliminary injunction, “specifically providing authority that the court may force a party to comply with an illegal act or pay an illegal ransom.” On April 18, 2023, the plaintiff dropped the request for the injunction to force Lehigh Valley Health Network to pay the ransom.\n",

      "World Password Day 2023 – Password Tips and Best Practices\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 3, 2023\n",
      "Thursday, May 4, 2023, is World Password Day. Established in 2013, the event is observed on the first Thursday of May with the goal of improving awareness of the importance of creating complex and unique passwords and adopting password best practices to keep sensitive information private and confidential.\n",
      "Passwords were first used to protect accounts against unauthorized access in computing environments in the 1960s. In 1961, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) started using the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). The system ran on an IBM 709 and users could access the system through a dumb terminal, with passwords used to prevent unauthorized access to users’ personal files.\n",
      "The system is widely believed to be the first to use passwords and was also one of the first to experience a password breach. In the mid-1960s, MIT Ph.D. researcher Allan Scherr needed more than his allotted 4-hour CTSS time to run performance simulations he had designed for the computer system. He discovered a way to print out all passwords stored in the system and used the passwords to gain extra time.\n",
      "Passwords are now the most common way to secure accounts and while passwordless authentication, such as biometric identifiers and single sign-on, are becoming more popular, in the short to medium term passwords are likely to remain the most widely used way of authenticating users and preventing unauthorized account access.\n",
      "The Importance of Creating Strong Passwords\n",
      "The use of passwords carries security risks, which World Password Day aims to address. One of the most common ways for hackers to gain access to accounts is to use stolen passwords. Phishing is used to target employees and trick them into disclosing their passwords, either via email, phone (vishing), or text message (SMiShing). Adopting 2-factor authentication will help to stop these attacks from succeeding. According to Microsoft, 2-factor authentication blocks more than 99% of automated attacks on accounts.\n",
      "Hackers also use brute force tactics to guess weak passwords and take advantage of default credentials that have not been changed. If rate limiting is not implemented to lock accounts after a set number of failed login attempts, weak passwords can be guessed in a fraction of a second. Even strong passwords can be guessed in seconds or minutes if they are not sufficiently long.\n",
      "In 2020, Hive Systems started publishing charts showing the time it takes for a hacker to brute force a password using a powerful, commercially available computer, and each year the table is updated to account for advances in computing technology. The chart clearly demonstrates the importance of creating strong passwords that include a combination of numbers, symbols, and upper- and lower-case letters, and ensuring passwords contain enough characters. We recommend a minimum password length of 14 characters.\n",
      "How Long Does it Take a Hacker to Brute Force a Password in 2023. Source: Hive Systems.\n",
      "Password Management Shortcuts Weaken Security\n",
      "Creating and remembering long, complex passwords is difficult for most people, and it is made even harder due to the need to create passwords to protect multiple accounts – A study by NordPass suggests the average person has around 100 passwords. Many people struggle to create and remember more than one strong and unique password, so with so many accounts to secure it is unsurprising that people take shortcuts, but those password management shortcuts significantly weaken password security.\n",
      "It is common for users to avoid creating unique passwords and they end up reusing the same password for multiple accounts. The problem with this is that if the password is compromised on one platform, either through brute force tactics, a phishing scam, or another method, all other accounts that use that password are at risk. Hackers take advantage of this common bad practice using a technique called credential stuffing. If they obtain a list of usernames and passwords from a data breach, they will attempt to access accounts on other unrelated platforms using those username and password combinations. This method only succeeds if there has been password reuse.\n",
      "Changing passwords slightly by adding a number or substituting characters when creating new accounts isn’t much more secure, and will leave accounts susceptible to brute force attacks. If a hacker obtains a username and password combination, various permutations of that password will be attempted with that username. Writing down passwords is also a very bad idea.\n",
      "Many businesses have implemented minimum complexity requirements for passwords, stipulating a minimum password length and composition requirements, yet it is common for employees to take shortcuts to make passwords easier to remember. It is possible to create a password that meets minimum complexity requirements yet is still incredibly weak. ‘Password’ is still one of the most commonly used passwords and it is usually the first one that is attempted when trying to hack an account. ‘P4ssw0rd!’ would meet the password complexity requirements imposed on many platforms, but it is still incredibly weak and offers next to no protection.\n",
      "Global Password Management Survey Reveals Poor Password Management Practices\n",
      "The 2023 Global Password Management Survey conducted by password management solution provider Bitwarden ahead of World Password Day confirms that extremely risky password practices are still incredibly common. The survey was conducted on more than 2,000 Internet users in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France, and Japan and asked questions about personal passwords, password habits at work, and the strategies that are adopted for managing passwords.\n",
      "Despite the risks, 90% of respondents admitted to reusing passwords for multiple accounts, up from 85% in 2022. In 2023, 19% of respondents said they reuse passwords on 1-5 sites, 36% reuse passwords on 5-10 sites, 24% reuse passwords on 10-15 sites, and 11% use the same password to secure more than 15 sites. 22% of respondents said they have been reusing the same password for more than a decade!\n",
      "While password manager use is increasing – 84% of respondents said they use a password manager at work – 54% of respondents said they store passwords in a document on their computer, and 29% write their passwords down. 54% of respondents said they rely on memory for managing passwords, up from 49% last year, which explains why 58% of respondents admitted to resetting their passwords regularly because they forget them. 12% of respondents said they reset passwords on a daily basis for this reason. Last year, 54% of respondents said their organization had experienced a cyberattack, with the percentage increasing to 60% this year, and 26% of respondents said they had been affected by a data breach in the past 18 months.\n",
      "Account security can be greatly improved with 2-factor authentication, and while there are strong feelings that the additional authentication makes accessing accounts cumbersome, 2-factor authentication is now being widely adopted. 92% of respondents said they use 2-factor authentication in the workplace, up from 88% last year. When asked why 2-factor authentication is not used for business or personal use, 48% said it was not used due to unawareness of the benefits, 47% said because passwords were believed to be strong enough, and 41% said because they did not think that accounts would be hacked. The same percentage said 2-factor authentication was not used because it slows down workflow.\n",
      "2-factor or multi-factor authentication is vital for protecting accounts. In the event of a phishing attack where an employee discloses their password, 2-FA/MFA can prevent that password from granting access to the account, thus preventing a costly data breach. However, while any form of 2-FA/MFA is better than single-factor authentication, phishing-resistant MFA provides the best protection. Threat actors are now using phishing kits that are capable of stealing session cookies and MFA codes, thus bypassing MFA. Phishing-resistant MFA removes the phishable human element and provides far greater protection. Further information on implementing phishing-resistant MFA has been published by CISA.\n",

      "World Password Day 2023 is the perfect time to assess password security and take steps to ensure that all accounts are properly secured with strong and unique passwords, and start following password best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure a strong, unique password is set for all accounts\n",
      "Use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols in passwords\n",
      "Use easy-to-remember passphrases rather than passwords, that have a minimum of 14 characters\n",
      "Never reuse passwords on multiple accounts\n",
      "Don’t use information in passwords that can be found in social media profiles (DOB, spouse or pet name, etc.) or is known to others\n",
      "Ensure 2-factor authentication is set up, especially for accounts containing sensitive data\n",
      "Use a secure password generator to generate random strings of characters\n",

      "NYSARC Columbia County Chapter (COARC) has started notifying certain individuals that some of their protected health information has potentially been obtained by unauthorized individuals in a July 2022 ransomware attack. According to the notifications, suspicious activity was detected within its network on July 19, 2022, that was consistent with a ransomware attack. Steps were immediately taken to contain the incident and an investigation was launched, which confirmed that the attacker had access to certain COARC systems for a limited period in July.\n",
      "The attack appears to have been conducted with the sole purpose of encrypting data for extortion purposes. It is not known if data exfiltration occurred but it could not be ruled out. COARC did not say if the ransom was paid. COARC said the types of information involved included names and one or more of the following: address, social security number, financial account, credit card information, medical information, student information, driver’s license, and passport number. No evidence of misuse of that information has been detected in the 9 months from the discovery of the breach to issuing notifications on April 28, 2023. COARC said additional security protocols have been implemented to better protect its network, email environment, and other systems from future attacks.\n",

      "SOC 2 Compliance Checklist\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 2, 2023\n",
      "An SOC 2 compliance checklist is a document used by organizations to prepare for an SOC 2 audit. However, as the nature of SOC 2 audits can vary from organization to organization, there is no one-size-fits-all checklist for SOC 2 compliance.\n",
      "SOC 2 is a voluntary compliance standard developed in 2010 by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Organizations wishing to demonstrate compliance with the standard undergo an SOC 2 audit conducted by an AICPA-certified public accountant or by an audit firm commissioned by AICPA. The resulting SOC 2 report can then be shared with third parties to prove the organization has implemented controls to secure their systems and data.\n",
      "In the healthcare industry, an SOC 2 report does not guarantee compliance with the standards of the HIPAA Security Rule because the controls mapped to the SOC 2 audit are discretionary. Nonetheless, it can be beneficial for Covered Entities and Business Associates to obtain an SOC 2 compliance certification in order to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with HIPAA and the Trust Services Criteria of AICPA´s Systems and Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2) standard.\n",
      "What are the Trust Services Criteria of SOC 2?\n",
      "There are five Trust Services Criteria of SOC 2 – security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Within each section, organizations have to meet specific “points of focus”, but – as mentioned above – controls are discretionary and determined by each organization and service auditor. Typically, service auditors have a set of general controls they look for, but these can be tailored to each organization and its operating environment.\n",
      "Additionally, other than security controls, the remaining four Trust Services Criteria are optional. Organizations can choose whether or not to include them in a SOC 2 audit depending on the services the organization provides and whether the points of focus are relevant to these services. For example, processing integrity controls would be applicable to an organization analyzing Protected Health Information, but not to an organization providing secure data storage services.\n",
      "What Should be in an SOC 2 Compliance Checklist?\n",
      "Due to the controls mapped to an SOC 2 audit being discretionary, and due to some Trust Services Criteria being optional, what should be in an SOC 2 compliance checklist depends on the nature of the organization’s operations and what the organization wants to demonstrate in an SOC 2 report. It is also important to be aware there are two types of SOC 2 report. Type 1 affirms an organization`s controls are designed effectively. Type 2 affirms the controls are being used effectively.\n",
      "Thereafter, the nature of an organization’s operations will determine which of the five Trust Services Criteria are included in the SOC 2 compliance checklist, while the reason for undergoing an SOC 2 audit will determine the points of focus and controls. Demonstrating a good faith effort to comply with HIPAA can be one reason for undergoing an SOC 2 audit, but organizations also undergo SOC 2 audits for management oversight, internal governance, and risk management purposes.\n",
      "As mentioned in the introduction to this article, there is no one-size-fits-all checklist for SOC 2 compliance. However, a typical SOC 2 compliance checklist for an organization in the healthcare industry would include most of the following:\n",
      "Security\n",
      "\n",
      "Are controls in place to comply with the Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguards of the Security Rule?\n",
      "Where appropriate, have web application firewalls been installed to defend against CSRF attacks, XSS attacks, and SQL injection?\n",
      "Are networks monitored for unauthorized access and/or is intrusion detection software integrated with an SIEM solution?\n",
      "Are sensitive accounts protected by 2FA (or equivalent)? Does the security awareness program include 2FA phishing simulation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Availability\n",
      "\n",
      "Are controls in place so the organization can guarantee a minimum service or contract level to users of the service being provided?\n",
      "Are the controls configured to account for events such as site failover and security incident handling?\n",
      "\n",
      "Processing Integrity\n",
      "\n",
      "Do controls exist to ensure data processing is complete, valid/necessary, accurate, timely, and authorized?\n",
      "Do controls exist to respond to individuals exercising their rights to inspect data and receive an accounting of disclosures?\n",
      "\n",
      "Confidentiality\n",
      "\n",
      "Are members of the workforce trained on what PHI is and when it can be permissibly used and disclosed?\n",
      "Is data encrypted at rest and in transit – including when it is created, stored, used, or transmitted on a personal device?\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy\n",
      "\n",
      "Are controls in place to comply with AICPA’s Privacy Management Framework and the requirements of the Privacy Rule?\n",
      "Is the data journey tracked from creation to disposal to ensure uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or authorized?\n",
      "\n",
      "SOC 2 Compliance Training\n",
      "One important consideration for organizations compiling a SOC 2 compliance checklist for a Type 2 audit is SOC 2 compliance training. This is because a Type 2 SOC 2 audit not only affirms controls are in place to comply with the Trust Services Criteria, but that the controls are being used effectively. This is likely the most common type of certification a Covered Entity would request when conducting due diligence on a Business Associate (or on another Covered Entity providing a service as a Business Associate).\n",
      "Most Covered Entities and Business Associates should have no difficulty integrating SOC 2 compliance training into existing Security Rule training. However, it may be necessary to tweak existing training to comply with SOC 2 points of focus such as malware detection, social engineering, and incident reporting. Organizations that experience challenges with providing both Security Rule training and SOC 2 compliance training should seek professional compliance advice.\n",

      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 1, 2023\n",
      "The Health Sector Cybersecurity and Coordination Center (HC3) has issued a fresh ransomware warning to the healthcare and public health (HPH) sector following a spate of attacks on the HPH sector in April by the Clop and LockBit ransomware groups.\n",
      "HC3 has issued multiple alerts about the Clop and LockBit ransomware-as-a-service groups which have conducted multiple attacks on the healthcare sector. Clop was behind the attacks on Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT solution in January/February 2023 and the 2022 attacks on the Accellion File Transfer Application (FTA), both of which exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in those solutions. The latest alert about LockBit was issued in December 2022 following multiple attacks on HPH sector organizations.\n",
      "The Clop group exploited the GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability (CVE-2023-0669) and stole data from around 130 organizations, and both groups have been observed exploiting two other recently disclosed vulnerabilities – CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351 – which are authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the widely used print management software, PaperCut MF/NG. Those two vulnerabilities were disclosed by the developer on April 19, 2023, and were corrected in PaperCut versions 20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 and later.\n",
      "On April 26, 2023, Microsoft announced that a threat actor known as Lace Tempest was exploiting the PaperCut flaws and that the activity overlapped with the FIN11 and TA505 threat groups,  both of which have ties to Clop. After exploiting the vulnerabilities, TrueBot malware was deployed, which is known to be used by the Clop ransomware operation. LockBit ransomware was deployed in some of the attacks.\n",
      "Network defenders have been advised to promptly patch their servers by updating to the latest versions of PaperCut. If that is not possible, there is a recommended workaround, which involves blocking all traffic to the web management port (9191) from external IP addresses on edge devices and blocking all traffic to default port 9191 on the server’s firewall. Users of Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT solution should rotate the Master Encryption Key, reset all credentials, review audit logs, and delete suspicious administrator and user accounts.\n",
      "Further recommended mitigations against attacks by Clop, LockBit, and other cybercriminal groups are detailed in the HC3 alert.\n",

      "HIPAA Updates and HIPAA Changes in 2023\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 1, 2023\n",
      "HIPAA was signed into law in 1996 and while there have been some significant HIPAA updates over the last twenty five years, the last set of major HIPAA updates occurred in 2013 with the introduction of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule.\n",
      "The next major HIPAA update is now due and is expected in the second half of 2023.\n",
      "The article below explains HIPAA updates and changes in more detail and can be used in conjunction with our HIPAA checklist to understand what is required to ensure compliance.\n",
      "Please use the form on this page to arrange your free copy of the checklist.\n",
      "Significant updates to HIPAA are long overdue, but steps were finally taken in December 2020, when HHS’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that detailed several proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A Final Rule is now due which will likely see those HIPAA changes implemented in 2023.\n",
      "There has also been a proposed update to align 42 CFR Part 2 – the Confidentiality Of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulations – more closely with HIPAA, and those Part 2 and HIPAA changes are also expected to be finalized in 2023.\n",
      "Major HIPAA Updates in the Past 25 Years\n",
      "Since HIPAA was signed into law there have been a few major HIPAA updates. The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules were introduced which limited uses and disclosures of protected health information, gave patients new rights over their healthcare data, and introduced a set of minimum security standards.\n",
      "Those HIPAA updates were followed by the incorporation of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which saw the introduction of the Breach Notification Rule in 2009 and the Omnibus Final Rule in 2013. Such major HIPAA updates placed a significant burden on HIPAA-covered entities and considerable time and effort were required to introduce new policies and procedures to ensure continued HIPAA compliance.\n",
      "It is now 10 years since the last major HIPAA update took effect. Over the past 10 years, various issues have arisen with HIPAA due to changes in working practices and advances in technology. Rather than tackle these issues with HIPAA Rule changes, OCR has favored issuing guidance to clear up misunderstandings over the requirements of HIPAA. However, we are now at a point when changes to HIPAA Rules are needed – and are about to be made.\n",
      "HIPAA Changes in 2023\n",
      "Over the past few years, there have been increasing calls for HIPAA changes to decrease the administrative burden on HIPAA-covered entities, but the HIPAA 2023 rules and regulations are currently much the same as they were in 2013. OCR responded to feedback from healthcare industry stakeholders by issuing a request for information (RFI) in December 2018 on potential changes to the HIPAA Rules. OCR sought comments from HIPAA-covered entities about possible changes to HIPAA Rules in 2019 and beyond, which are mostly concerned with the easing of certain administrative requirements and the removal of certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that have been limiting or discouraging the coordination of care. The comment period closed on February 12, 2019.\n",
      "OCR asked 54 different questions in its RFI. Some of the main aspects that were under consideration were:\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients’ right to access and obtain copies of their protected health information and the time frame for responding to those requests (Currently 30 days)\n",
      "Removing the requirement to obtain written confirmation of receipt of an organization’s notice of privacy practices\n",
      "Promotion of parent and caregiver roles in care\n",
      "Easing of restrictions on disclosures of PHI without authorization\n",
      "Possible exceptions to the minimum necessary standard for disclosures of PHI\n",
      "Changes to HITECH Act requirements for the accounting of disclosures of PHI for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations\n",
      "Encouragement of information sharing for treatment and care coordination\n",
      "Changing the Privacy Rule to make sharing PHI with other providers mandatory rather than permissible.\n",
      "Expansion of healthcare clearinghouses’ access to PHI\n",
      "Addressing the opioid crisis and serious mental illness\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, then OCR Director, Roger Severino, said, “We are committed to pursuing the changes needed to improve quality of care and eliminate undue burdens on covered entities while maintaining robust privacy and security protections for individuals’ health information.”\n",

      "The aim of the HHS is to implement changes that will make compliance less of a burden without negatively affecting patient privacy or decreasing the security of individuals’ protected health information (PHI). There are no planned changes to the HIPAA Security Rule, but several HIPAA Privacy Rule changes have been proposed.\n",
      "It has been suggested that in many of the areas covered by the RFI, the best solution may not be HIPAA rule changes. Guidance was issued in 2022 and it is likely that further HIPAA guidance will be issued in 2023 to tackle some of the issues currently experienced with HIPAA compliance by clearing up misconceptions and correcting false interpretations of the HIPAA requirements. However, changes to HIPAA in 2023 are now likely to be implemented, although it may take until 2024 for those changes to become enforceable.\n",
      "Proposed HIPAA Privacy Rule Changes in 2023\n",
      "OCR issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on December 10, 2020, that detailed the HIPAA changes to the Privacy Rule due to be implemented, based on the responses to its December 2018 RFI. The proposed changes are limited, and several HIPAA Privacy Rule changes that healthcare industry stakeholders have been campaigning for have not been included. Most of the proposed HIPAA changes are relatively minor tweaks to strengthen patient access to PHI, facilitate data sharing, and ease the administrative burden on HIPAA-covered entities.\n",
      "In 2021, OCR sought feedback on the proposed HIPAA changes for 60 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register, with the comment period extended for a further 45 days to give healthcare industry stakeholders more time to review the proposed changes and provide their feedback. OCR has read the comments and the publication of the Final Rule is now imminent.\n",
      "The proposed updates to the HIPAA Privacy Rule are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing patients to inspect PHI in person and take notes or photographs of their PHI.\n",
      "Changing the maximum time to provide access to PHI from 30 days to 15 days.\n",

      "The Proposed HIPAA Changes Will Create Challenges for Healthcare Providers\n",
      "The pending HIPAA updates are intended to ease the administration burden on HIPAA-covered entities, although in the short term, the burden will be increased. Updates will need to be made to policies and procedures and changes will be required for notices of privacy practices, although there will not, at least, be the requirement to obtain written acknowledgment that updated NPPs have been received.\n",
      "What is certain is HIPAA officers and other compliance staff will have a busy few months when the Final Rule is published. OCR will provide sufficient notice before the 2023 HIPAA changes take effect and become enforceable, but there will likely be a lot of work to be done. It will be important to create a plan for making all of the required changes to ensure they are fully implemented ahead of the compliance deadline.\n",
      "When the Final Rule is published, there will be a requirement to change policies and procedures where necessary, and that will require retraining of employees. HIPAA requires training to be provided to the workforce during or soon after onboarding, and after any material change in policies and procedures. HIPAA training may not need to be provided to the entire workforce, but a significant number of employees will need to be trained, and that is likely to place a considerable burden on covered entities and has the potential to cause workflow disruptions.\n",
      "Improved access to medical records could pose problems for healthcare providers, who will need to ensure they have sufficient staffing and efficient procedures for verifying identities and providing copies of records – especially as the time frame for providing those records will be shortened from 30 days to 15 days. The extension will also be shortened to 15 days, giving healthcare organizations a maximum of 30 days to provide the requested records.\n",
      "The definition of EHRs has also been updated to include billing records, and these will need to be provided to patients who request a copy of their PHI. That has the potential to make it more time-consuming to provide copies, as billing records are often kept in different systems than healthcare records. It may be necessary to access two different systems in order to provide patients with a copy of their records.\n",
      "It will be easy for bottlenecks to occur and important not to get into a situation where 15 day extensions are regularly required. There could well be a need to prioritize requests to make sure patients who urgently need a copy of their records get them in a timely manner. Bear in mind that OCR is laser-focused on healthcare providers that fail to provide patients with timely access to their medical records.\n",

      "Another of the changes related to patient access is the requirement to allow patients to take notes and photographs of their PHI. There will need to be designated places where patients can inspect PHI privately and, if required, take photographs. Healthcare providers will need to implement safeguards to ensure patients are not taking photographs of PHI they are not authorized to see.\n",
      "The proposed HIPAA changes prohibit covered entities from imposing unreasonable measures on individuals exercising their right of access, including unreasonable identity verification requirements. That has the potential to cause problems for healthcare providers.\n",
      "A definition has also been proposed for a personal health application. If finalized, patients must be allowed to have their records sent to a personal health application of their choosing. However, there may be privacy risks associated with doing so, and patients will need to be made aware of those risks. That will add an additional burden on healthcare providers, who may not necessarily have the required information to determine whether there is a privacy and security risk.\n",
      "Proposed Part 2 and HIPAA Changes in 2023\n",
      "In November 2022, OCR and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) which sees both Part 2 and HIPAA changes to better align these regulations.\n",
      "Part 2 protects patient privacy and records related to treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) with HIPAA applying to protected health information. SUD records are treated differently as they are highly sensitive and require greater protection and restrictions than other health information covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While these additional protections are important, they can hamper care coordination due to the barriers that they put in the way of information sharing.\n",
      "The proposed changes are intended to ease the complexity of compliance with HIPAA and Part 2, break down barriers to information sharing, and improve care coordination, without removing protections for patients. The update expands patient rights regarding the uses and disclosures of their SUD records.\n",
      "The key changes that were proposed are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Single patient consent for all future uses and disclosures of SUD records for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.\n",
      "Permitted to redisclose SUD records in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule\n",
      "Patients will be able to obtain an accounting of disclosures of their SUD records and request restrictions on certain disclosures\n",
      "Expansion of prohibitions on the use and disclosure of Part 2 records in civil, criminal, administrative, and legislative proceedings\n",
      "Part 2 programs must establish a complaints process about Part 2 violations and must not require patients to waive the right to file a complaint as a condition of providing treatment, enrollment, payment, or eligibility for services.\n",
      "The breach notification requirements will apply to Part 2 records, which will be covered by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.\n",
      "The HIPAA Privacy Rule Notice of Privacy Practices requirements have been updated to address uses and disclosures of Part 2 records and individual rights with respect to those records.\n",
      "The HHS will be able to impose civil money penalties for violations of Part 2, in line with HIPAA and the HITECH Act\n",
      "\n",
      "The NPRM was issued in November 2022 and there is a 60-day comment period, so it is highly likely that the final rule will be issued in 2023. Covered entities will then be given time to implement the changes before they become enforceable.\n",
      "HITECH Act Updated in 2021 Regarding Recognized Security Practices\n",
      "Many healthcare industry stakeholders had been campaigning for the addition of a safe harbor for HIPAA-covered entities and business associates that have adopted a common security framework and have implemented industry-standard security best practices, yet still experienced a data breach. It is not possible to prevent all cyberattacks and data breaches, and it is unfair to punish HIPAA-regulated entities for impermissible disclosures of ePHI when they have made all reasonable efforts to secure their systems.\n",
      "A bill was proposed in 2020 that called for the HHS to consider the recognized security practices that have been adopted by HIPAA-regulated entities, that have been in place for the 12 months prior to a data breach occurring when deciding on financial penalties and other sanctions. The bill, HR 7898, was signed into law by President Trump on January 5, 2021.\n",

      "The purpose of the bill is to encourage healthcare organizations to invest in security and adopt a recognized security framework by providing an incentive. The HITECH Act update has not created a safe harbor for HIPAA-regulated entities that have adopted a security framework and have implemented industry-standard security best practices, but OCR will consider the efforts made with respect to security when making determinations in its investigations of complaints and data breaches.\n",
      "HIPAA-regulated entities that are able to demonstrate they have adopted recognized security practices will benefit from a decrease in the length and extent of audits and investigations of data breaches and OCR will consider recognized security practices as a mitigating factor to reduce any financial penalties that would otherwise have been applied.\n",
      "In 2022, in response to another request for information, OCR published a video that explains what recognized security practices are and the evidence that can be submitted to prove they have been in place. OCR said that when investigations are launched, OCR will write to the HIPAA-regulated entity and provide an opportunity for evidence of recognized security practices to be submitted.\n",
      "HIPAA Fines and Settlements Due to be Shared with Victims of HIPAA Violations\n",
      "In addition to requesting information on recognized security practices, OCR sought comments on how to implement a requirement of the HITECH Act regarding financial penalties and settlements for HIPAA violations. Section 13410(c)(1) of the HITECH Act requires OCR to share a portion of the funds it receives from its HIPAA enforcement activities with the victims of HIPAA violations. This is important, as there is no private cause of action in HIPAA, which means individuals cannot sue HIPAA-regulated entities for HIPAA violations that have resulted in harm being caused.\n",
      "The problem for OCR – which is why this requirement has not been implemented to date – is the difficulty in implementing a fair method of determining what victims should receive. In its April 6, 2022, RFI, OCR requested comments to help OCR with establishing a methodology under which an individual who is harmed by an offense punishable under HIPAA may receive a percentage of any civil money penalty or monetary settlement collected with respect to the offense.\n",
      "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has shared a methodology for sharing funds, but OCR is seeking comment on any alternative methodologies. The main problem, however, is identifying the types of harms that should be considered in the distribution of CMPs and monetary settlements to harmed individuals, as “harm” is not defined by statute.\n",
      "No timescale has been provided on when a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will be issued in this regard, or when funds will start to be shared with victims of HIPAA violations. These HIPAA changes could occur in 2023, but it may be 2024 before this HITECH Act requirement is implemented.\n",
      "HIPAA Changes Due to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19\n",
      "In response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic, the HHS announced major changes to the enforcement of HIPAA compliance in 2020, which will remain in place for the duration of the nationwide COVID-19 public health emergency or until the Secretary of the HHS declares the public health emergency is over. These “unprecedented HIPAA flexibilities” were announced in March and April by means of Notices of Enforcement Discretion and are intended to ease the burden on healthcare organizations and business associates that are having to overcome major challenges testing and treating COVID-19 patients. The changes to HIPAA enforcement have been introduced to ensure that HIPAA compliance does not get in the way of the provision of high-quality patient care.\n",
      "On April 11, 2023, OCR announced that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services will not be renewing the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, which is due to expire on May 11, 2023. That means the flexibilities introduced through the following Notifications of Enforcement Discretion will come to an end at 11:59 pm on May 11, 2023. From that date and time there will be no further flexibilities and non-compliance will be penalized in the same manner as before the COVID-19 pandemic. There is one exception concerning telehealth. OCR will implement a 90-day transition period, where the flexibilities will continue until 11:59 pm on August 11, 2023, and fines will not be issued with regard to the good faith provision of telehealth services up to that date.\n",
      "Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications\n",
      "The first Notice of Enforcement Discretion was announced by OCR on March 17, 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has seen social distancing measures introduced, and with hospitals dealing with huge numbers of cases, Americans are being encouraged to remain indoors. In order to continue to provide quality care to patients while reducing the risk of patients transmitting or contracting COVID-19, telehealth services have been expanded. The CMS has also expanded telehealth to include all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n",
      "To help ensure that patients receive the care they need, OCR has announced that it will not impose sanctions and penalties on healthcare providers in association with the good faith provision of telehealth services for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment, regardless of whether the telehealth services are directly related to COVID-19. OCR will not impose penalties on healthcare providers in relation to the use of everyday communication technologies for providing those services, even if the platforms used are not completely compliant with HIPAA. For instance, it is permissible to use Skype (rather than Skype for Business), FaceTime, Google Hangouts Video, and Zoom. It is not permitted to use public-facing platforms to provide these services, such as Facebook Live and TikTok.\n",
      "“We are empowering medical providers to serve patients wherever they are during this national public health emergency,” said Roger Severino, OCR Director. “We are especially concerned about reaching those most at risk, including older persons and persons with disabilities.”\n",
      "This Notification of Enforcement Discretion will end at 11:59 pm on May 11, 2023. The ‘grace period’ will last for 90 days, so the hard date for compliance is 11:59 pm on August 11, 2023.\n",
      "Notification of Enforcement Discretion to Allow Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information by Business Associates for Public Health and Health Oversight Activities\n",
      "The second Notice of Enforcement Discretion was announced by OCR on April 2, 2020, and concerns uses and disclosures of PHI by business associates of HIPAA-covered entities for reasons related to public health and health oversight activities. HIPAA does not permit business associates to disclose PHI for public health and health oversight activities unless it is stated that they can do so in their business associate agreement (BAA) with a HIPAA-covered entity.\n",

Should such a use or disclosure occur, the business associate must notify the covered entity within 10 days of the use or disclosure.\n",
      "“The CDC, CMS, and state and local health departments need quick access to COVID-19 related health data to fight this pandemic,” said Roger Severino. “Granting HIPAA business associates greater freedom to cooperate and exchange information with public health and oversight agencies can help flatten the curve and potentially save lives.”\n",

      "The third Notice of Enforcement Discretion was announced by OCR on April 9, 2020 – backdated to March 13, 2020 – and concerns the good faith participation in the operation of COVID-19 testing centers. OCR will be exercising enforcement discretion and will not impose sanctions and penalties on healthcare providers, including pharmacies, and business associates that participate in the operation of COVID-19 testing sites such as mobile testing centers, walk-up facilities, and drive-through testing centers that only provide COVID-19 specimen collection or testing services to the public.\n",
      "“We are taking extraordinary action to help the growth of mobile testing sites so more people can get tested quickly and safely,” said Roger Severino.  “President Trump has ordered the federal government to use every tool available to help save lives during this crisis, and this announcement is another concrete example of putting the President’s directive into action.”\n",

      "Notice of Enforcement Discretion Regarding Online or Web-Based Scheduling Applications for Scheduling of COVID-19 Vaccination Appointments\n",
      "OCR announced a further Notice of Enforcement Discretion on January 19, 2021, that concerns the scheduling of appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations. OCR said financial penalties and sanctions would not be imposed on HIPAA-covered entities or their business associates for violations of the HIPAA Rules in relation to the good faith use of online or web-based scheduling applications (WBSAs) for scheduling appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations.\n",
      "WBSAs that would not be fully compliant with the HIPAA Rules under normal circumstances can be used for scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments without penalty, although it is not permitted to use a WBSA that does not incorporate reasonable security safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of ePHI and the Notice of Enforcement Discretion does not apply if the solution provider has prohibited the use of the WBSA for scheduling healthcare appointments.\n",
      "OCR explained that the Notice of Enforcement Discretion does not apply to the use of a WBSA for anything other than scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments, such as arranging appointments for other medical services or for screening individuals for COVID-19 prior to arranging an in-person healthcare visit.\n",
      "OCR encourages HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates to implement reasonable safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of healthcare data, such as adhering to the minimum necessary standard when inputting data, using encryption if available, and ensuring all privacy settings in the WBSA are activated.\n",
      "OCR will be exercising enforcement discretion retroactive to December 11, 2020. This Notification of Enforcement Discretion will end at 11:59 pm on May 11, 2023.\n",
      "HIPAA Penalties Could Officially Change in 2023\n",
      "A HIPAA change occurred in 2019 concerning the penalties for HIPAA violations. OCR issued a Notice of Enforcement Discretion in 2019 which stated that OCR has adopted a new penalty structure for non-compliance with HIPAA Rules after a reevaluation of the requirements of the HITECH Act.\n",
      "The HITECH Act called for penalties for HIPAA violations to be increased and, in 2013, the HHS implemented a new HIPAA penalty structure with minimum and maximum penalties set for the four penalty tiers, based on the level of culpability. In each category, a maximum penalty of $1.5 million, per violation category, per year was set. The HHS reviewed the language of the HITECH Act in 2019 and interpreted the requirements of the HITECH Act differently. “Upon further review of the statute by the HHS Office of the General Counsel, HHS has determined that the better reading of the HITECH Act is to apply annual limits.”\n",
      "Rather than a maximum penalty of $1.5 million per year in all four categories, the maximum fine was reduced in the first three tiers. The new penalty structure is detailed in the infographic below. Note the figures below are the amounts in 2013 and are subject to inflation increases. The current minimum and maximum penalties, adjusted for inflation, can be found here.\n",
      " \n",
      "Currently, OCR is using the new penalty structure, as detailed in the Notice of Enforcement Discretion published in the Federal Register. While that remains in effect indefinitely, the new penalty structure is not legally binding and can be changed at any time. It is possible that this change to HIPAA will be made official in 2023, although first, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will need to be issued. OCR is more likely to continue to use its new interpretation under its Notice of Enforcement Discretion without making it official.\n",
      "OCR has been pushing Congress to increase the maximum penalties for HIPAA violations as the total funds from OCR’s enforcement actions decreased significantly when the new penalty structure was introduced. OCR’s budget is extremely stretched as funding for the department has remained flat for years despite increasing numbers of hacking incidents and data breaches which has significantly increased OCR’s workload.\n",
      "Given the expected HIPAA updates in 2023 outlined in OCR’s NPRMs, further HIPAA changes in 2023 are not expected. OCR is however expected to continue to issue guidance to explain how HIPAA applies in certain situations to clear up confusion about the requirements of HIPAA, as was the case in 2022 in response to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and the overturning of Roe v Wade, which removed the federal right to an abortion. OCR originally confirmed, through guidance, how the HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to disclosures of reproductive health information, but has since published an NPRM to tackle evolving issues related to this case.\n",
      "Proposed Changes to Privacy Rule for Reproductive Health Care\n",
      "According to the NPRM, issues relating to currently permissible uses and disclosures of PHI have evolved due to an increasing number of women in anti-abortion states travelling to other states to have “legal” terminations. Under §164.512(e) of the Privacy Rule, covered entities are permitted to disclose PHI for civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings.\n",
      "However, some states have enacted anti-abortion legislation that criminalizes the facilitation of a termination regardless of where it takes place. Courts in these states could subpoena PHI from covered entities in neighboring “legal” states in pursuit of a criminal conviction against any person who has assisted an individual in obtaining an abortion – including the covered entity.\n",

      "OCR is concerned that the fear of PHI being disclosed for a procedure considered legal in the location where the procedure was administered could discourage patients from sharing important information with their healthcare providers and dissuade some healthcare providers from performing terminations for out-of-state citizens.\n",
      "Consequently, OCR is proposing changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule that include the creation of a new category of PHI – “reproductive health care” – and placing limitations on how it can be used and disclosed. These limitations are similar to those for genetic information inasmuch as it will not be possible to disclose reproductive health care records even with a patient’s authorization.\n",
      "Importantly, the proposals will not only cover terminations, but other reproductive healthcare information, such as the provision of contraceptives (or the provision of contraception advice), fertility treatments, and pregnancy screening. Miscarriage management will also be included in the new category of PHI, as will diagnoses and treatments of conditions related to the reproductive system even if the recipient of the diagnoses and treatments is not of reproductive age.\n",
      "Other measures proposed in the NPRM include a new category of uses and disclosures – “Attested uses and disclosures” – which may well be used to align the HIPAA Privacy Rule with Part 2 privacy requirements. Under the new category, recipients of PHI will have to attest that it will not be further used or disclosed for prohibited purposes – i.e., in the case of reproductive health care, to support a civil, criminal, or administrative investigation or proceeding.\n",
      "Covered entities are already being alerted to the fact that, if the proposals are finalized, any false attestations will be considered notifiable data breaches, while the person(s) that further disclose attested PHI will be in violation of §1177 of the Social Security Act for the wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. Violations of this section are considered to be criminal violations carrying a maximum penalty of up to ten years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000.\n",
      "Other HIPAA Rule Changes May Lead to Future Updates\n",
      "HIPAA rule changes are not exclusive to the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. There have been a number of HIPAA rule changes relating to transaction code sets and identifiers (Part 162 of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations). Usually, these rule changes have a limited impact on covered entities and business associates; however, a proposed HIPAA rule change published in December 2022 could have implications for many day-to-day healthcare operations.\n",
      "The proposed HIPAA rule changes were published by CMS to resolve an issue concerning healthcare attachment transactions. These transactions occur when a health plan needs further information from a healthcare provider to authorize a treatment or pay a bill. Healthcare providers can also provide further information when submitting an authorization request or bill to accelerate treatment and/or payment.\n",
      "The issue exists because further information cannot be “attached” to an existing transaction and has to be faxed or mailed separately. To resolve the issue, CMS is proposing three new transaction codes. However, in order to authenticate users, ensure the integrity of the attachment, and guarantee nonrepudiation, attachments transmitted using the new codes will have to be digitally signed. CMS has therefore proposed a standard for acceptable e-signatures.\n",
      "Compliance with the e-signature standard is only necessary when covered entities use the transaction codes to submit attachments electronically. There is no requirement to digitally sign attachments when they are faxed or sent through the mail. Therefore, like most previous Part 162 HIPAA rule changes, the proposals will have a limited impact on covered entities and business associates.\n",
      "However, the possibility exists that the proposed standard may be extended to other transactions in the future, and then to day-to-day healthcare operations. As this article discusses, there are a number of ways in which e-signatures are used in day-to-day healthcare operations; and, if the e-signature requirements are rolled out across the rest of the Administrative Simplification Regulations, covered entities and business associates may have to make some significant procedural changes.\n",

      "90 Degree Benefits Facing Class Action Lawsuit Over 181,500-Record Data Breach\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 1, 2023\n",
      "A lawsuit has been filed against 90 Degree Benefits over a breach of the protected health information of 181,543 individuals. Unauthorized system activity was detected on or around December 10, 2022, and the forensic investigation determined its systems had been accessed by unauthorized individuals between December 5, 2022, and December 10, 2022. During that time, the attackers had access to parts of its network that contained patients’ and health plan members’ names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health information, and payment information. Affected individuals were notified about the breach by mail on or around April 7, 2023.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges 90 Degree Benefits knew or should have been aware that it was a target for hackers, given the extent to which the healthcare industry has been targeted in recent years, especially considering 90 Degree Benefits experienced a similar data breach in February 2022. The February data breach should have made it clear that its data security measures were not sufficient and needed to be improved, yet despite that earlier breach, data security was still inadequate.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges the plaintiffs have incurred out-of-pocket expenses and have had to spend time protecting against misuse of their data, and that they are at imminent risk of identity theft and fraud, with that risk continuing for years to come. As a result, the plaintiffs and class members will likely have to continue investing time and money to protect themselves from fraud for the rest of their lives.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges negligence, breach of implied contract, and violations of the Wisconsin Deceptive Trade Practices Act and Wisconsin Confidentiality of Health Records Law. The lawsuit seeks class action certification, a jury trial, damages, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, and injunctive relief, including encryption of data, changes to data retention practices, the implementation of a comprehensive information security program, regular third-party security audits/penetration tests, and for the court to prohibit 90 Degree Benefits from storing protected health information in cloud-based databases.\n",
      "The lawsuit names 90 Degree Benefits Inc. and 90 Degree Benefits, LLC as the defendants and the plaintiffs as Steven Greek and Jon Boyajian. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs and class are represented by attorneys from the law firms Ademi LLP, Murphy Law Firm, and Federman & Sherwood.\n",

      "One Brooklyn Health Sued Over 235K-Record Data Breach\n",
      "Posted By Steve Alder on May 1, 2023\n",
      "One Brooklyn Health, a New York City-based network of three acute care hospitals – Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, Interfaith Medical Center, and Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center – is facing a class action lawsuit over a data breach that was discovered in November 2022.\n",
      "On November 19, 2022, One Brooklyn Health identified suspicious activity within its computer network. The network was immediately secured, and the forensic investigation confirmed that an unauthorized third party had intermittently accessed its network between July 9, 2022, and November 19, 2022. The document review took until March 21, 2023, and notification letters were sent on April 20, 2023. The information exposed and potentially stolen in the attack included names, dates of birth, billing and claims data, treatment details, medical record numbers, prescriptions, health insurance information, and Social Security numbers. More than 235,000 patients were affected.\n",
      "On April 26, 2023, a lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Kings, on behalf of plaintiff Kiya Johnson and similarly situated individuals by the law firms Wittels McInturff Palikovic and Shub & Johns LLC. The lawsuit alleges One Brooklyn Health knew that it stored sensitive patient information and that it was a target for cybercriminals and that it was obligated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to protect that data yet failed to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures thus allowing unauthorized individuals to access its network and steal patient data.\n",
      "The lawsuit alleges the plaintiff and class members have had to spend considerable time and money protecting themselves against misuse of their protected health information and that they have and will continue to suffer harm and have been placed at an imminent, immediate, and continuing risk of identity theft and fraud. The lawsuit states 8 causes of action: negligence (plaintiff and class), negligence per se, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of confidence, intrusion upon seclusion/invasion of privacy, breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of New York General Business Law.\n",
      "The lawsuit seeks class action status, a jury trial, damages, restitution, and injunctive relief, with the latter including improvements to data security practices.\n",
